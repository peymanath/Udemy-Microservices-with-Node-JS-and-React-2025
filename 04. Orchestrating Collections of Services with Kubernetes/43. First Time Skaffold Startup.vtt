00:00.650 --> 00:04.970
We have a fully assembled scaffold HTML file, so now all we have to do is start scaffold up.

00:05.270 --> 00:09.020
Fortunately to start up scaffold, you're really just have to remember exactly one command.

00:09.260 --> 00:14.000
Back at my terminal, I'm inside of my root project directory of blog and so I should see the scaffold

00:14.240 --> 00:16.580
HTML file right there to start up scaffold.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.110
We will run scaffold.

00:18.910 --> 00:19.600
Dev.

00:19.750 --> 00:20.440
That's it.

00:21.310 --> 00:24.910
So I'm going to run that command and we're going to see a tremendous amount of output start to scroll

00:24.910 --> 00:25.390
by.

00:26.270 --> 00:28.190
You might start to see warnings or something like that.

00:28.190 --> 00:29.750
You might see stuff that says not found.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.730
You might see stuff that says, Hey, you've got uncommitted changes.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.670
You see anything like that, do not sweat it.

00:34.880 --> 00:39.770
The first time you try to run scaffold, it's going to probably try to just rebuild all of your images,

00:39.770 --> 00:41.830
even though we've already built them once already.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.850
If it's trying to rebuild images, don't sweat it.

00:43.850 --> 00:45.050
Just let it do its thing.

00:45.440 --> 00:50.480
This entire initial setup process is probably going to take a good couple of minutes because we're essentially

00:50.480 --> 00:52.610
talking about building six different images here.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.070
So I'm going to go ahead and just pause this video right now.

00:55.070 --> 00:59.390
When we come back to the next video, we'll take a look at what happens when scaffold finishes the startup

00:59.390 --> 01:00.140
process.
