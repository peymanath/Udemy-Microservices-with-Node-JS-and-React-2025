00:00.980 --> 00:05.480
We've now seen how to work with cluster IP services and node port services.

00:05.510 --> 00:10.180
So now we're going to go around to the rest of the microservices inside of our app, specifically comments,

00:10.190 --> 00:13.400
query and moderation and integrate those into our Kubernetes cluster.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.070
Here's the steps we need to go through for each one.

00:16.520 --> 00:21.050
We're going to go through the source code for each of those three, and we're going to update the URLs

00:21.050 --> 00:25.080
in each of them to make sure that they post events to the event bus CRV.

00:25.100 --> 00:30.050
Because remember, right now they are trying to send events to local host 4005.

00:31.600 --> 00:35.230
Then for each of those we will build an image and push them to Docker Hub.

00:35.710 --> 00:40.990
We'll then create a deployment in a cluster IP service for each of them and apply those all to our cluster.

00:41.290 --> 00:46.750
And then finally, we're going to update our event code so that it once again sends events to comments,

00:46.750 --> 00:50.110
query and moderation, because we commented out that code just a moment ago.

00:50.740 --> 00:56.200
So the bad news here is that we're going to be essentially doing the same thing three times over for

00:56.200 --> 00:57.490
comments, query and moderation.

00:57.490 --> 00:58.510
That's the bad news.

00:58.540 --> 01:03.160
The good news is we're going to get a lot of practice very quickly in creating services and deployments.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.690
So let's get to it.

01:04.720 --> 01:09.280
We're going to first take a look at comments in moderation, update URLs in each of those to reach out

01:09.280 --> 01:12.460
to event bus service whenever they need to create an event.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.180
I'll begin inside of comments.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.480
I'm going to find the index file inside there.

01:19.770 --> 01:23.430
And then I'm going to scroll through and just look for local host.

01:23.700 --> 01:24.750
Here's one right here.

01:24.930 --> 01:28.590
So I'm going to replace local host with event bus CRV.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.170
Well, then keep going.

01:33.550 --> 01:34.270
Here's another.

01:34.270 --> 01:36.760
So event bus CRV.

01:37.660 --> 01:38.650
And I think that's it.

01:39.070 --> 01:41.870
So make sure that you have two updates inside of here.

01:41.890 --> 01:47.140
If you do a control F and look for local host, you should do or get zero results.

01:47.860 --> 01:49.690
I'll then save this file and close it.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.460
So that's one down.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.340
Let's now move on to moderation.

01:54.290 --> 01:54.740
Inside there.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.390
I'll find the index dogs file.

01:58.570 --> 02:00.580
Here's a local host once right here.

02:00.610 --> 02:03.850
I'll update that to event bus CRV.

02:04.420 --> 02:05.290
Save the file.

02:06.440 --> 02:06.800
And.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.400
Okay, I think that's it as well.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.380
I'll do another.

02:09.590 --> 02:11.150
Control f for local host.

02:11.660 --> 02:12.470
No issue.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.600
They'll save that and close it.

02:15.750 --> 02:18.930
And then finally inside of query, I'll find index indexes.

02:20.910 --> 02:22.170
I'll go down inside of here.

02:24.360 --> 02:30.390
And it looks like we have one right here where we tried to do that kind of sync operation.

02:31.020 --> 02:35.880
So I'm going to make sure that I replace local host with event bus CRV.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.310
And I'll save the file.

02:41.510 --> 02:41.870
All right.

02:41.870 --> 02:46.820
So now comments, moderation and query are all attempting to reach out to the event plus cluster IP

02:46.820 --> 02:48.920
service, which is exactly what we want.

02:49.820 --> 02:54.200
So we're now going to go around inside of our terminal to all three of those directories and build images

02:54.200 --> 02:56.300
out of each of them and push them up to Docker Hub.

02:58.740 --> 02:59.730
Back at my terminal.

03:01.340 --> 03:03.530
I'll first start off inside of comments.

03:05.110 --> 03:11.380
I'll do a docker, build t my docker ID slash comments and then a dot.

03:14.210 --> 03:14.630
Looks good.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.910
I'll do a Docker push.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.490
Comments.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.070
And that should take just a moment or two.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.500
I'll let let it just do its thing very quickly.

03:30.160 --> 03:30.910
Very good.

03:31.750 --> 03:32.900
So that's it for comments.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.680
I'm now going to change over to a moderation.

03:38.350 --> 03:39.850
I'll do a Docker build.

03:41.210 --> 03:42.740
Moderation in their.

03:45.060 --> 03:46.560
And a darker push.

03:52.810 --> 03:54.910
And it looks like that one's going to have a little bit of an upload.

03:54.910 --> 03:59.590
So while that is running, I'll open up another terminal window just to save ourselves a little bit

03:59.590 --> 04:02.590
of time here so you don't have to watch my slow upload speed.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.100
So our last one is going to be for query.

04:06.130 --> 04:07.390
It's a little change in the query.

04:08.170 --> 04:09.490
I'll build that image.

04:15.730 --> 04:17.320
And I'll do a Docker push.

04:19.650 --> 04:20.340
Rick Perry.

04:25.270 --> 04:25.870
All right.

04:27.390 --> 04:29.430
So we have now updated the URLs.

04:29.430 --> 04:31.560
We built images and push them to Docker Hub.

04:32.160 --> 04:36.120
Now, last thing we need to do is create a deployment and a cluster IP service for each one.

04:37.150 --> 04:42.400
This video might run a little bit long, but I figure let's get all these steps done, at least in one

04:42.400 --> 04:44.980
video, just kind of kind of get this busy work out of the way.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.480
So let's just keep going for right now.

04:46.930 --> 04:49.750
So we're going to create a deployment and cluster IP service for each one.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.640
We'll do that back inside of our code editor.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.180
Remember, we're going to write out a config file to get started for each of those.

04:56.310 --> 04:57.930
Inside my infra directory.

04:58.260 --> 05:04.350
I will first take care of comments so I'll make a new file called comments devel html.

05:06.380 --> 05:09.230
Rather than writing out the entire deployment file from scratch.

05:09.230 --> 05:15.230
I'll just go and copy paste all the config from the event bus deployment file because just about all

05:15.230 --> 05:18.920
of our config around these deployments are going to be identical for right now.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.900
So here, event bus depot.

05:20.930 --> 05:25.610
I'm going to copy everything inside of here, including the cluster IP service at the very bottom.

05:26.340 --> 05:29.190
And I'll paste it into this new common stash double.

05:31.620 --> 05:35.790
And then going to go through here and update event bus to say comments instead.

05:36.590 --> 05:38.210
So I'll do one.

05:39.570 --> 05:40.470
Here's to.

05:42.100 --> 05:42.910
Here's three.

05:44.760 --> 05:45.630
Here's for.

05:47.290 --> 05:48.970
And here's five.

05:50.350 --> 05:54.040
So make sure that you have no mention of event buzz inside the deployment anymore.

05:55.090 --> 06:01.030
I'll then go down to the cluster IP service and I will replace event bus once.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.440
Weiss.

06:04.310 --> 06:06.110
And three times.

06:07.850 --> 06:14.150
And then finally remember comments is not listing on 4005 comments listings on port 4001.

06:14.330 --> 06:17.120
So I will update that as well to 4000.

06:18.410 --> 06:20.450
And one, make sure you don't have 40,000 won.

06:20.450 --> 06:21.860
Just 4001.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.510
All right, one down, two to go.

06:24.520 --> 06:25.690
So I'm going to save this file.

06:27.210 --> 06:30.270
I'll then create another new file inside of my k aids directory.

06:31.080 --> 06:34.230
I'll call this one moderation dash devel.

06:36.290 --> 06:38.870
I'm going to paste that default config once again.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.850
And I'll go through the same thing again.

06:41.860 --> 06:42.180
So.

06:42.190 --> 06:43.050
Event bus.

06:43.060 --> 06:47.080
This time I'm just going to do a multi select since you just saw me do all those updates.

06:47.530 --> 06:49.510
So event bus five times.

06:49.540 --> 06:51.490
Update them all to moderation.

06:54.010 --> 06:55.540
And then down inside the service.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.610
I'm going to update those three to moderation.

06:59.910 --> 07:04.110
And then remember, moderation listens on, what is it, 4003.

07:04.110 --> 07:07.920
I think I'll do a quick check inside of the indexed file for moderation.

07:08.310 --> 07:09.900
So, yes, 4003.

07:11.460 --> 07:14.640
So I'll update the port and target ports to 4003.

07:15.800 --> 07:16.940
I'm going to say this file.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.600
And then finally, one last file inside of K Eights.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.060
I'll do a query.

07:24.060 --> 07:25.590
Double HTML.

07:26.520 --> 07:30.540
In a paste once again and one more multi select.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.290
So there's query five times through.

07:37.230 --> 07:38.880
Replace these three with query.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.120
And then this one is 4002.

07:44.750 --> 07:45.800
And I'll save the file.

07:46.960 --> 07:47.230
All right.

07:47.230 --> 07:47.950
That should be it.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.840
So we've now made updates or created these three new deployment files.

07:52.850 --> 07:56.920
Each one consists of a deployment and a cluster IP service.

07:58.210 --> 08:02.140
It's not the last thing we have to do is take those files and apply them into our cluster.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.900
Let's go back over to our command line.

08:05.810 --> 08:12.500
I'm going to change into that k infra directory, the infra k eighths and then we're going to apply

08:12.500 --> 08:14.270
all the config files inside of here.

08:14.270 --> 08:19.130
We could apply them all one by one, but it would save us just a little bit of time to apply them all

08:19.130 --> 08:23.510
inside of one go to apply multiple config files with one single command.

08:23.510 --> 08:30.530
We write out CTL, apply F and then Dot and once again dot means find all the different config files

08:30.530 --> 08:33.140
inside of the current working directory and apply them.

08:34.320 --> 08:37.500
So I'll run that and then I'll see a bunch of things being created.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.740
So I've now got my query service.

08:39.750 --> 08:44.520
There's the query deployment, A, I've got my comment service, comments deployment and so on.

08:45.410 --> 08:51.830
We can now do a cube, CTL, get pods, and we should now see some additional pods running.

08:51.830 --> 08:54.380
And all of them should have a status of running as well.

08:54.530 --> 08:59.570
If any of them do not have a status of running, then chances are that you made a mistake during pushing

08:59.570 --> 09:03.830
these images off to Docker Hub or alternatively maybe inside of a config file.

09:04.340 --> 09:09.560
So if you see a status of any of these of something like air image back off or error image pull any

09:09.560 --> 09:15.750
kind of air whatsoever, the first thing to do to debug it is to copy that pod's name and then do a

09:16.070 --> 09:19.430
little describe pod and then the pods name.

09:20.850 --> 09:24.990
So run that command and then you'll see a series of events down here which hopefully should give you

09:24.990 --> 09:26.970
some more information about what is going on.

09:27.730 --> 09:32.480
We should also make sure that all the different services were created as well, so we can do a CTL,

09:32.530 --> 09:39.730
get services and we should see comments, event bus moderation, post cluster OST, which is our node

09:39.730 --> 09:41.290
port and query.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.490
Well, I'd say this looks pretty good.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.530
Now, the very last thing we have to do.

09:47.860 --> 09:52.960
Is make sure that we update the event bus to once again send events to comments, query and moderation.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.890
So we'll take care of that in just a moment and then start to do a final test of our application.
