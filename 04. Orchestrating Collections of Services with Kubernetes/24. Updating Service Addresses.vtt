00:00.890 --> 00:05.120
In this video, we're going to go into our post application and update all the requests that we're making

00:05.120 --> 00:09.410
over to our event bus to use the name of the event bus service.

00:09.830 --> 00:11.570
Well, then do the same thing with the event bus.

00:11.570 --> 00:13.250
So we'll open up the event bus code.

00:13.250 --> 00:17.990
And any time we try to make a request over to our post service or the post application, we'll make

00:17.990 --> 00:19.820
sure we update that URL as well.

00:20.030 --> 00:26.420
Now, as you can guess, we are going to start to add in eventually some new pods for our comment stuff

00:26.420 --> 00:28.010
for moderation and query.

00:28.250 --> 00:31.310
Those are all going to need some services to be created as well.

00:31.310 --> 00:35.210
And we're going to need to make sure that for each of those services, we update all the appropriate

00:35.210 --> 00:36.980
URLs inside of our code base, too.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.980
So eventually we're going to have to update a lot of URLs.

00:39.980 --> 00:44.990
But right now, let's just focus on posts and event bus and just get those two things working.

00:45.850 --> 00:46.210
All right.

00:46.210 --> 00:50.530
So inside of our code editor, we're going to find our post application once again and find the indexed

00:50.920 --> 00:51.460
file.

00:52.870 --> 00:57.520
So here's where we are making a post request to slash posts or we have the handler for it.

00:58.930 --> 01:01.120
And this is where we reach out to our event bus.

01:01.540 --> 01:04.180
So no longer are we going to make a request to local host.

01:04.180 --> 01:09.710
Instead, we make a request to the service that is governing access to the event bus.

01:09.730 --> 01:13.080
So it will be event bus service.

01:14.080 --> 01:19.300
And it's absolutely always worth when you type in one of these service names inside of your code, always

01:19.300 --> 01:25.150
worth going over to your terminal doing a quick it'll get services and just double checking the spelling.

01:26.350 --> 01:28.720
And also double checking the port as well.

01:29.380 --> 01:33.190
So event bus XV at Port 4005.

01:33.970 --> 01:34.840
Does it line up?

01:34.870 --> 01:35.980
Yes, it does.

01:37.660 --> 01:42.580
I'll then continue down and see if there are any other requests being issued in here to our event bus.

01:43.060 --> 01:43.320
Nope.

01:43.330 --> 01:44.290
Don't think there are.

01:44.860 --> 01:46.990
So I'll save this file and close it.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.480
I'll then go over to my event.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.750
Plus, I'll open up the index file inside there as well.

01:53.890 --> 01:58.600
This is where we are making our series of requests to all the different sub or micro services we have

01:58.600 --> 01:59.440
inside of our app.

02:00.300 --> 02:05.910
So at present we don't have any implementation or comments, moderation or query.

02:05.910 --> 02:08.210
So I'm just going to temporarily comment those out.

02:08.220 --> 02:13.590
We'll come back and uncomment them very shortly as we start to bring the comments, moderation and query

02:13.590 --> 02:15.870
microservices live inside of our cluster.

02:15.870 --> 02:19.950
But for right now, if we tried to make requests to those endpoints, we would end up with an error.

02:19.980 --> 02:21.300
Probably not what we want.

02:22.350 --> 02:25.380
So we'll just leave behind the request to our posts.

02:25.380 --> 02:26.400
Microservice.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.910
I'm going to find local hosts right there.

02:29.940 --> 02:33.090
We no longer want to make a request to local host.

02:33.100 --> 02:38.820
Instead, we want to make requests to post cluster IP survey because that's how we get access to the

02:38.820 --> 02:39.690
post spot.

02:41.060 --> 02:45.320
Once again, I'll go to my terminal, do a CTL, get services and just verify the name.

02:45.710 --> 02:46.100
Yep.

02:46.100 --> 02:50.300
Posts Cluster IP XB at port 4000.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.420
So posts bluster.

02:55.740 --> 02:59.370
IP CRV still at port 4000.

03:01.100 --> 03:01.400
Cool.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.690
So I'll save this as well.

03:03.490 --> 03:08.770
So we've now made changes to two of our microservices and we need to somehow now deploy those.

03:09.130 --> 03:12.220
We spoke about how we update deployments just a little bit ago.

03:12.220 --> 03:16.120
So as a quick reminder, see, where's our diagram for it?

03:16.990 --> 03:17.440
Somewhere.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.490
Here it is right here.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.830
So we've made an update to our code.

03:20.830 --> 03:26.230
If we want to deploy that, we're going to rebuild the image or our event bus and four posts will then

03:26.230 --> 03:31.240
push those images to Docker Hub and then run the command queue, CTL, blah blah blah with the deployment

03:31.240 --> 03:31.690
name.

03:32.860 --> 03:34.140
So we've updated our code.

03:34.150 --> 03:36.340
Let's go and rebuild both those images.

03:37.490 --> 03:38.870
Again at my terminal.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.840
I'll change back into my.

03:42.950 --> 03:44.240
Event bus directory.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.830
And do a Docker build.

03:47.910 --> 03:52.800
Dash TX Stephen Grider Event Dash Bus Dot.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.330
Don't forget the dot at the end.

03:57.370 --> 03:57.820
There's that.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.050
I'll push that image.

03:59.050 --> 04:00.610
The Docker push.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.240
Event bus.

04:06.950 --> 04:08.900
That'll take just a minute or two.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.080
Or maybe it'll be really quick.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.210
Let's see how long it takes.

04:11.900 --> 04:12.650
Very good.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.900
So I'll go and do the same thing for post as well.

04:15.100 --> 04:18.170
They'll go up one directory, change into posts.

04:19.810 --> 04:26.260
We'll do a Docker, build your Docker ID, slash posts and a dot at the very end.

04:29.300 --> 04:29.600
Cool.

04:30.110 --> 04:32.180
And a darker push.

04:34.030 --> 04:34.840
Her posts.

04:40.520 --> 04:40.910
Cool.

04:41.860 --> 04:42.280
All right.

04:42.280 --> 04:47.890
So now to make sure that we update both of our deployments, we'll do the CTL rollout, restart deployment

04:47.890 --> 04:51.580
or our post deployment and the event plus deployment as well.

04:52.540 --> 04:55.420
If we forget the name of those deployments, we can always do a queue.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.400
It'll get deployments.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.650
So there's the name of the two deployments that we need to restart.

05:02.190 --> 05:04.050
So let's do the post 1/1.

05:04.410 --> 05:08.370
So we'll do a little rollout restart deployment.

05:11.420 --> 05:12.650
Those double.

05:14.300 --> 05:19.360
CTL Rollout Restart Event Bus Depot.

05:20.280 --> 05:20.580
Oh.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.020
Restart deployment.

05:26.430 --> 05:27.090
There we go.

05:29.740 --> 05:33.220
I'll then list out all my pods and make sure that they both just got restarted.

05:33.220 --> 05:35.110
So a little get pods.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.220
Oh, this is interesting.

05:37.220 --> 05:42.680
You'll notice that I ran this command quickly enough to see the old pod that was being executed for

05:42.680 --> 05:43.930
the event, plus deployment.

05:43.940 --> 05:49.220
It's now being terminated and is being replaced with this brand new one because we are trying to replace

05:49.220 --> 05:53.570
or restart or I should say yes, replace the pod that was already running.

05:54.510 --> 05:55.800
I'll do another get pod's.

05:55.830 --> 05:58.550
It looks like that other one has now been fully terminated.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.690
And we've now got just these two pots.

06:02.580 --> 06:04.890
Well, the last thing we need to do is a quick test.

06:04.890 --> 06:06.570
So we're going to open up postmen.

06:06.570 --> 06:13.410
We're going to try to manually create a post by issuing a post request to our post service or the post

06:13.410 --> 06:14.400
microservice.

06:14.670 --> 06:19.560
And then we'll make sure that the event bus and posts are somehow in communication by viewing their

06:19.560 --> 06:22.710
logs and making sure that they are exchanging some events.

06:22.950 --> 06:26.700
This video is running a little bit long, however, so let's take care of that little test in just a

06:26.700 --> 06:27.210
moment.
