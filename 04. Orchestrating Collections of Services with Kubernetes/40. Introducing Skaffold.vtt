00:01.760 --> 00:06.080
Our application is up and running successfully inside of our cluster, which is fantastic.

00:06.080 --> 00:10.430
But as I've mentioned several times in the last couple of videos, making changes to our code base right

00:10.430 --> 00:12.140
now is a real pain.

00:12.350 --> 00:16.430
So you might recall looking at this diagram, these are the steps that we go through any time we want

00:16.430 --> 00:18.980
to change the image that is used by a deployment.

00:19.160 --> 00:23.870
So we've been saying that to really change the code running inside of our pods, we had to make an update

00:23.870 --> 00:24.580
to our code.

00:24.590 --> 00:28.730
We had to rebuild the image, push it to Docker Hub and then run a command.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.440
This is a total nightmare.

00:30.440 --> 00:35.210
To have to do that would result in a very, very unpleasant development process.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.470
Now, it is still important for you to understand this process right here, because this is how we're

00:39.470 --> 00:42.500
going to eventually deploy code in a production style environment.

00:42.530 --> 00:46.400
It's still important for you to understand this, but in a development environment, clearly this is

00:46.400 --> 00:48.110
not a very great approach.

00:48.680 --> 00:53.540
So when we are developing code actively inside of a Kubernetes cluster, we are going to instead use

00:53.540 --> 00:55.370
a tool called scaffold.

00:55.880 --> 01:01.880
Scaffold is a command line tool that we're going to use to automatically do a lot of different tasks

01:01.880 --> 01:04.040
in our Kubernetes dev environment.

01:04.040 --> 01:08.540
Specifically, you can use scaffold in a production environment, but for you and I really just going

01:08.540 --> 01:10.610
to focus on using it in development.

01:11.240 --> 01:16.370
The number one thing that we are interested in with Scaffold is that it makes it super easy to update

01:16.370 --> 01:18.190
code in a running pot.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.980
It's essentially just as quickly as if we were not using Kubernetes at all.

01:22.940 --> 01:27.950
The other really great thing about scaffold is that it makes it very easy for us to create and delete

01:27.950 --> 01:32.030
all the different objects that are tied to some project very, very quickly.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.200
And that's really important.

01:33.200 --> 01:38.030
If we start working between multiple different Kubernetes projects, when you're running a cluster on

01:38.030 --> 01:40.460
your local machine, there is just one cluster.

01:40.460 --> 01:45.500
So if you start to work between different projects, maybe right now you're working on this application

01:45.500 --> 01:49.730
in this course, maybe tomorrow you're going to be working on another tutorial or a production app.

01:49.730 --> 01:50.510
Who knows?

01:50.510 --> 01:55.130
You're going to be want to be able to change between these different sets of objects very quickly,

01:55.400 --> 01:58.190
and you can do that very quickly using scaffold.

01:59.170 --> 01:59.560
All right.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.190
So best way to understand scaffold is, of course, to use it.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.800
So let's just go ahead and install this thing and get a better idea of what is going on.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.100
The homepage for scaffold is scaffold dev.

02:09.130 --> 02:13.060
So inside of a new browser tab, I will go to scaffold dev.

02:15.040 --> 02:18.400
Once here you will see a link on the left hand side that says Git Scaffold.

02:18.520 --> 02:25.660
So we'll click on that and then you'll see installation directions on here for Linux, Mac OS and Windows.

02:26.260 --> 02:30.470
The Windows installation directions are assuming that you have chocolaty already installed.

02:30.490 --> 02:35.350
If you do not have chocolate or if you don't know what it is, I encourage you to do a google search

02:35.350 --> 02:35.810
of chocolate.

02:35.950 --> 02:38.050
Make sure you get it installed on your local system.

02:39.360 --> 02:44.130
If you follow the Mac OS install directions, this is assuming that you have homebrew installed as well.

02:44.130 --> 02:47.460
And of course if you don't have homebrew installed again, do a quick google search.

02:47.460 --> 02:48.450
Install a homebrew.

02:49.260 --> 02:52.860
So go ahead and follow the directions for your appropriate operating system.

02:52.860 --> 02:57.930
In just about every case, it's going to be a pretty simple install one command for Mac OS, one for

02:57.930 --> 03:00.900
Windows, and just a handful of commands if you're on Linux.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.020
So go ahead and get that all set up.

03:04.040 --> 03:08.510
We'll come to get back together in the next video and we'll start to use Scaffold inside of our project.
