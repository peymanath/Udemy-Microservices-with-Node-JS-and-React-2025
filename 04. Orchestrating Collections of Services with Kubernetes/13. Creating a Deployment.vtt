00:01.190 --> 00:04.190
In this video, we're going to start to write out a config file for a deployment.

00:04.190 --> 00:07.490
So let's get to it back inside to my code editor.

00:07.490 --> 00:13.610
I'm going to delete the Post Gamble file if you want to, you can back up this file or just change the

00:13.610 --> 00:15.080
extension, something like that.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.480
You want to make sure you don't have this file anymore.

00:17.480 --> 00:22.550
So if you want to keep a backup, I would encourage you to add on a like old or something like that

00:22.550 --> 00:23.870
extension to the very end.

00:24.470 --> 00:28.910
So I'm going to delete that file because we don't want to create an individual pod anymore.

00:29.630 --> 00:35.210
And then inside my kids directory, I'm going to make a new file called post dash devel.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.890
The DEP on there indicates that this file is going to create a deployment.

00:39.890 --> 00:41.900
So devel is just deployment for short.

00:41.900 --> 00:42.560
That's all.

00:44.220 --> 00:44.760
Inside of here.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.700
We're going to write out once again some config to create a deployment.

00:47.730 --> 00:51.780
And inside this config, we're going to say that we want to run some number of pods that are going to

00:51.780 --> 00:53.370
run our post image.

00:53.370 --> 00:54.660
So let's get to it.

00:54.690 --> 00:58.800
A lot of the code or configuration we're going to write inside of here is going to be very similar to

00:58.800 --> 01:00.690
the stuff that we just wrote out for a pod.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.730
We'll first start off with an API version.

01:04.490 --> 01:07.520
And in this case, we're going to put an APS slash V one.

01:08.030 --> 01:12.470
So remember, there are certain buckets of different types of objects we have access to.

01:12.650 --> 01:18.020
In this case, the deployment is inside this bucket of different objects called app slash v one.

01:18.290 --> 01:21.380
A pod, as you will recall, was inside of just v one.

01:22.420 --> 01:25.150
Well, then specify the kind of object that we are trying to create.

01:25.360 --> 01:26.320
So it's a deployment.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.740
Well, then set up some metadata.

01:28.860 --> 01:31.350
And in this case, we're just going to assign a name to it.

01:31.620 --> 01:35.670
So let's say post dash depot, that is going to be the name of my deployment.

01:36.060 --> 01:40.140
Again, I'm putting on the dash double here so that if I ever print out some logs or something like

01:40.140 --> 01:45.000
that about all the objects inside my cluster, i'll see devel and know that this is a deployment.

01:46.510 --> 01:48.610
After that, I'll put in a spec section.

01:49.060 --> 01:52.570
So this is going to specify exactly how this deployment should behave.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.860
The first property will designate inside of here is replicas.

01:57.950 --> 01:59.930
And I'm going to give it a one for right now.

02:00.140 --> 02:04.700
Replicas is the number of pods that we want to create running some particular image.

02:06.130 --> 02:09.230
So in this diagram over here, I'm showing three separate pods.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.050
Right now, we're not going to run three separate pods.

02:11.050 --> 02:13.120
We're going to run just one by itself.

02:15.470 --> 02:18.980
Now the next little piece of configuration here is going to be just a little bit mysterious.

02:18.980 --> 02:23.900
So we'll write it out and then take write out a little bit additional config after that.

02:23.900 --> 02:26.660
And we'll talk about how these two parts of config kind of work together.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.430
I'm going to say selector.

02:29.260 --> 02:31.090
Then match labels.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.850
And then app posts.

02:35.140 --> 02:39.850
Remember that inside of a YAML file indentation is a big deal, so you need to make sure that you've

02:39.850 --> 02:43.750
got one level of indentation on selector, then two and then three.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.350
So again, we'll talk about what this is in just a second.

02:47.370 --> 02:49.620
First, we're going to write out another little bit of config.

02:50.330 --> 02:51.500
I'm going to say template.

02:52.410 --> 02:54.930
Then metadata labels.

02:57.930 --> 02:59.670
And then app posts.

03:01.070 --> 03:01.430
All right.

03:01.430 --> 03:05.840
So these two sections right here, the selector thing and this metadata thing right here, are really

03:05.840 --> 03:06.800
working together.

03:06.890 --> 03:09.800
This might sound really you know, it's funny.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.900
It might sound like kind of crazy.

03:11.900 --> 03:17.510
But to be honest with you, a deployment kind of has a hard time figuring out which pods it should manage

03:17.510 --> 03:18.620
inside of our cluster.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.870
In other words, if a set of pods get created, we have to somehow give the deployment some information

03:23.870 --> 03:25.880
and tell it, Hey, these pods over here.

03:25.910 --> 03:27.830
These are the ones you need to manage.

03:27.830 --> 03:32.390
And that's what the goal of this selector and metadata labels app thing is all about.

03:32.660 --> 03:37.160
This selector right here is saying, take a look at all the different pods that have been created.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.970
Find all the pods with a label of app posts.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.640
So this right here is what we refer to as a label.

03:43.640 --> 03:48.830
It's essentially, well, a label, it's a key value pair is just applying some arbitrary information

03:48.830 --> 03:49.610
to a pod.

03:50.390 --> 03:52.370
App right here doesn't really have any special meaning.

03:52.370 --> 03:57.020
We can set up labels with any structure you can imagine, so we can have a label of like that right

03:57.020 --> 03:57.470
there.

03:59.010 --> 04:03.090
So in this case, we are telling the deployment that we wanted to find all the different pods with a

04:03.090 --> 04:04.710
label of app posts.

04:04.980 --> 04:07.200
And those are the pods that it should be in charge of.

04:08.270 --> 04:14.030
Then inside this template section, the template is where we specify the exact configuration of a pod

04:14.030 --> 04:15.710
that we want this deployment to create.

04:16.530 --> 04:20.580
So this right here is some configuration that is going to be applied to the pod that the deployment

04:20.580 --> 04:21.420
is going to make.

04:21.840 --> 04:25.740
We are saying that we want the pod to have a label of app posts.

04:26.130 --> 04:30.660
So again, this part right here and this part right here are really working together to tell the deployment

04:30.660 --> 04:32.910
about which pods it should try to manage.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.630
After that, we'll then set up a spec.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.450
This back again.

04:38.450 --> 04:43.640
Everything inside this template thing right here can be really thought of as a pod spec or a pod config

04:43.640 --> 04:46.850
file, very similar to the pod config file we had just a moment ago.

04:47.150 --> 04:52.040
So the spec section right here is describing the specification or the configuration options for the

04:52.040 --> 04:53.300
pod that we're trying to make.

04:54.180 --> 04:56.070
So we will designate containers.

04:56.070 --> 04:57.600
We're going to have one container.

04:57.870 --> 04:59.580
So containers is an array, remember?

04:59.580 --> 05:03.000
And inside of YAML, we designate an array entry with a single dash.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.240
We'll say that the container should have a name of post.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.310
And it should run the image of your docker ID so not mine.

05:11.310 --> 05:12.960
Whatever your doctor ID is.

05:13.380 --> 05:17.070
Slash posts and then version 001.

05:17.070 --> 05:17.730
Like so.

05:18.730 --> 05:19.510
And that's it.

05:19.870 --> 05:21.640
That is our deployment config.

05:22.090 --> 05:25.930
Now, over time, you're going to see that there are many other options or pieces of configuration we

05:25.930 --> 05:27.080
can specify in here.

05:27.100 --> 05:31.810
This is about as barebones a configuration as we can get when we are creating a deployment.

05:33.580 --> 05:34.570
Let's save this.

05:35.050 --> 05:39.220
And then finally, we're going to go back over to our terminal and we're going to try to apply this

05:39.220 --> 05:40.270
to our cluster.

05:40.480 --> 05:44.500
Remember, any time we want to make a change to our cluster, we create those config files and we will

05:44.500 --> 05:49.210
run that CTL, apply command that we saw that we use just a moment ago to create a pod.

05:49.840 --> 05:58.750
So to apply this config file, we will run cube, ctrl, apply chef and then post devel yaml.

05:59.920 --> 06:00.670
And that's it.

06:01.300 --> 06:05.050
Now, the deployment has been created, but what does that really do for us?

06:05.230 --> 06:06.760
Well, let's take a quick pause right here.

06:06.790 --> 06:10.690
We're going to come back the next video and we'll see what creating the deployment really did to our

06:10.690 --> 06:11.350
cluster.
