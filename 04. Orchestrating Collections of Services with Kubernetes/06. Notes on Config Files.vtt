00:00.820 --> 00:01.420
In this video.

00:01.420 --> 00:06.400
We're going to learn more about these config files that we're going to write to create actual pods,

00:06.400 --> 00:08.050
services and deployments.

00:08.080 --> 00:11.020
So let's take a look at a couple of notes on these config files.

00:12.010 --> 00:12.330
Okay.

00:12.340 --> 00:16.630
So first off, these config files that we're going to write are going to tell Kubernetes about the different

00:16.630 --> 00:20.290
deployments, pods and services that we want to create inside of our cluster.

00:20.470 --> 00:25.150
By the way, collectively, we refer to deployments, pods, services and other similar things that

00:25.150 --> 00:27.190
we create in Kubernetes as objects.

00:27.340 --> 00:32.080
So in other words, we are creating config files to create and configure objects.

00:33.530 --> 00:38.000
Is config files are going to be written entirely in YAML syntax if you're not familiar with yaml.

00:38.030 --> 00:38.630
Don't sweat it.

00:38.630 --> 00:42.500
It's really easy syntax to pick up, especially if you're already familiar with JSON.

00:42.530 --> 00:46.310
It's essentially JSON with just less curly braces and whatnot.

00:47.270 --> 00:51.350
Now, the next couple of notes I'm going to write out here are going to seem a little bit strange for

00:51.350 --> 00:55.070
right now, but as soon as we start writing our first config file, I think they will make a little

00:55.070 --> 00:55.820
bit more sense.

00:55.820 --> 00:59.180
So I'm just going to say them right now because they are so important to understand.

00:59.330 --> 01:02.450
We're not going to understand it just yet, but you'll see it in just a moment.

01:03.440 --> 01:08.920
So first off, whenever we write a config file, we're always going to store these files with our projects.

01:08.930 --> 01:13.430
So in other words, we're going to commit these to get and make sure that we store them in some kind

01:13.430 --> 01:14.600
of source control.

01:14.900 --> 01:20.270
The reason for that is that these config files that we write are really documentation of what our Kubernetes

01:20.270 --> 01:21.410
cluster is doing.

01:21.440 --> 01:26.600
The config files can tell another engineer who starts to look at your code about the different deployments,

01:26.600 --> 01:28.850
services and pods that you have created.

01:28.850 --> 01:31.040
And it's really the best documentation.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.340
You're going to have to tell other engineers what your cluster is doing.

01:35.520 --> 01:39.060
With that in mind, it is possible to create these object things.

01:39.060 --> 01:45.120
So again, an object is deployment pod service without using config files and I highly recommend that

01:45.120 --> 01:46.590
you do not do this.

01:46.680 --> 01:51.990
You should not create objects directly at the command line by writing in commands to create an object.

01:52.020 --> 01:57.600
We're always going to write out these config files because they are going to be, again, a source of

01:57.600 --> 02:02.820
documentation to tell you in other people in the future exactly what is going on inside your cluster.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.160
And the reason I say this so prominently is because once you start to read the Kubernetes documentation,

02:08.160 --> 02:13.110
they're going to tell you to run commands at your terminal to directly create objects without using

02:13.110 --> 02:14.130
any config file.

02:14.460 --> 02:20.490
I highly recommend you only follow the Kubernetes documentation for testing purposes and learning purposes.

02:20.490 --> 02:25.860
Do not create resources or objects directly at the terminal in a production environment.

02:25.920 --> 02:31.530
There are a couple of exclusions to that rule and we'll talk about what those exclusions are later on.

02:32.630 --> 02:37.040
The other thing is that blog posts, in addition, will frequently tell you to run commands to create

02:37.040 --> 02:39.350
objects as opposed to using these config files.

02:39.350 --> 02:43.340
And if you see a blog post that tells you to do that, just close the blog post because honestly the

02:43.340 --> 02:46.060
person is probably not giving you the best advice.

02:46.070 --> 02:50.990
Yeah, you can use the command, but who knows what else in that blog post are cutting corners on as

02:50.990 --> 02:51.370
well.

02:51.380 --> 02:56.390
Now I don't really mean to smash on anyone who is going with that approach inside of a blog post, but

02:56.390 --> 02:57.830
it's just my personal opinion.

02:58.010 --> 03:00.200
Use a config file at all times.

03:00.770 --> 03:03.380
So now at this point in time, you're probably saying, okay, like whatever.

03:03.380 --> 03:04.370
Stephen, get to it.

03:04.370 --> 03:05.780
What is in a config file?

03:05.810 --> 03:06.680
All right, I'm with you.

03:06.680 --> 03:07.430
I understand.

03:07.460 --> 03:11.120
So one more pause and we're going to write out our first config file in the next video.
