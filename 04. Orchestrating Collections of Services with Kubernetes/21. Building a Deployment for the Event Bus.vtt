00:00.880 --> 00:04.690
In the last video, we discussed how we're going to add in this new event, bus, pod and then a cluster

00:04.690 --> 00:07.420
IP service for both posts and event bus.

00:07.660 --> 00:11.770
I know a lot of this stuff probably seems pretty crazy right now, but I got some good news for you

00:11.800 --> 00:12.970
as soon as we get through this.

00:13.180 --> 00:17.530
One last hurdle, we're going to start to take a look at a tool that is going to automate wiring up

00:17.530 --> 00:18.910
a lot of the stuff for us.

00:18.910 --> 00:20.980
So it's going to make life a lot easier.

00:21.040 --> 00:24.850
You do have to go through all this stuff at least once by hand, though, just so you really understand

00:24.850 --> 00:26.440
what is going on behind the scenes.

00:27.340 --> 00:27.850
All right.

00:27.850 --> 00:29.770
So we have to go through a couple of different steps.

00:29.770 --> 00:34.330
And so just to make sure that everything is crystal clear, put together a quick diagram to understand

00:34.330 --> 00:38.290
the steps we're about to go through to get the event bus and post working together.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.360
The first thing we'll do is create an image for the event bus.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.290
Well, then push that image up to Docker Hub.

00:46.590 --> 00:49.350
Well, then create a deployment for the event bus.

00:49.650 --> 00:55.170
That deployment is going to create one pod for us automatically, and that pod is going to be this thing

00:55.170 --> 00:55.890
right here.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.770
After that pod comes into it exist existence.

00:59.860 --> 01:04.300
We will then create a cluster IP service for the event bus and for posts.

01:04.630 --> 01:06.790
And so that's going to be that thing and that thing.

01:06.790 --> 01:12.040
And again, these cluster IP services are going to teach these pods how to access each other inside

01:12.040 --> 01:12.790
the cluster.

01:14.190 --> 01:18.930
After that, we're going to do just one last additional little step to wire this stuff up all together.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.400
So let's get started with step number one.

01:21.400 --> 01:25.540
Right now, we're going to build an image for the event bus to get started.

01:25.540 --> 01:27.280
I'm going to flip back over to my terminal.

01:28.980 --> 01:34.770
I'm going to change into my event bus directory and inside there I'll build a new image so I'll do a

01:34.770 --> 01:39.870
docker build dash TX even greater event dash bus.

01:40.630 --> 01:45.130
And then don't forget the dot at the very end that in case we want to use the current working directory.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.760
For all the source code inside the image.

01:48.850 --> 01:49.540
So I'll run that.

01:49.540 --> 01:52.420
And as you'll see, that image gets built very, very quickly.

01:54.110 --> 01:54.330
Okay.

01:54.470 --> 01:55.490
That's step number one.

01:56.350 --> 02:00.820
Step number two, we're going to push that image off to Docker Hub so that the deployment can very easily

02:00.820 --> 02:03.910
pull down that image when it decides that it's time to create the pod.

02:05.590 --> 02:12.280
So back inside the event bus directory will do a docker push your docker ID slash event dash bus.

02:14.680 --> 02:18.400
That's going to take the image that we just built and throw it up to Docker Hub.

02:19.750 --> 02:22.990
It's a pretty small image, so it'll just take a little minute or two.

02:24.590 --> 02:24.890
All right.

02:24.890 --> 02:29.450
After that's all done, we're then going to create a deployment for the event bus.

02:29.840 --> 02:33.710
The deployment that we're going to create is going to be just about identical in nature to the post

02:33.710 --> 02:35.240
deployment that we already put together.

02:35.270 --> 02:39.120
So really just going to copy, paste, all that configuration that we already wrote out, we're just

02:39.140 --> 02:43.130
going to change one or two names to refer to Event Bus as opposed to posts.

02:44.210 --> 02:45.500
To create the deployment itself.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.960
Don't forget, we're always going to create a config file.

02:48.410 --> 02:49.850
So back inside, my editor.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.620
I'm going to find that infra directory.

02:54.010 --> 02:59.800
Inside there is K inside of k l make a new directory called event dash.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.660
Bus Dash Depot.

03:01.990 --> 03:02.500
HTML.

03:05.260 --> 03:07.630
I'll then open up the post deployment file.

03:08.140 --> 03:09.120
Because I'm not kidding.

03:09.130 --> 03:11.110
We're really just going to copy, paste all this stuff.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.600
Inside of the post deployment file.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.860
I'm going to copy everything.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.890
Go back over to the event bus deployment file and paste.

03:21.610 --> 03:25.750
I'm then going to go through and everywhere that I see the word posts, I'm going to replace it with

03:25.750 --> 03:26.770
event bus.

03:27.590 --> 03:29.270
So here's number one right here.

03:31.720 --> 03:32.650
Here's to.

03:34.950 --> 03:36.150
Here's three.

03:38.550 --> 03:39.150
Or.

03:40.920 --> 03:41.820
And five.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.580
Inside of the event plus deployment file.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.650
I should now be able to do a find.

03:48.710 --> 03:51.470
I'll look for posts and I should have zero results.

03:51.890 --> 03:55.790
So make sure you replaced every instance of posts with event bus instead.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.400
Well, then save the file.

04:00.270 --> 04:05.820
And now we'll go ahead and apply this configuration file to Kubernetes using Cube CTL.

04:06.660 --> 04:07.890
So back at my terminal.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.430
It looks like I have finished pushing up the event bus image.

04:11.440 --> 04:12.160
That's great.

04:12.990 --> 04:16.530
I'm going to change back over to my K aids directory.

04:17.790 --> 04:21.720
And inside there, I've got my event plus deployment file that we just created.

04:22.020 --> 04:23.370
So we'll do a cube.

04:23.550 --> 04:25.230
It'll apply.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.550
Event Bus Depot EML.

04:34.480 --> 04:39.190
So it looks like we've got the deployment created and that should automatically create the pod for us.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.790
Let's just list out all of our different pods and make sure that it actually was created.

04:43.240 --> 04:43.750
I'll do a cube.

04:43.870 --> 04:45.220
It'll get pods.

04:45.790 --> 04:49.060
And sure enough, there's my event plus pod right there.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.190
So it looks like it is up and running.

04:52.830 --> 04:58.680
So although that looks great right now, we have no effective way to really have any communication between

04:58.680 --> 05:00.900
this event bus pod and the post pod.

05:01.170 --> 05:05.880
And so that is why we need to come back and add in these cluster IP services.

05:06.150 --> 05:11.640
Again, they technically can communicate, but the IP address assigned to these pods is variable and

05:11.640 --> 05:13.380
we can't really predict it ahead of time.

05:14.150 --> 05:19.820
The cluster IP services are going to give us a well known, very easy to predict URL that we can type

05:19.820 --> 05:25.190
in any time we want to have our event bus communicate over to posts or anytime we want post to communicate

05:25.190 --> 05:26.540
over to event bus.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.690
So let's take a quick pause right here.

05:28.690 --> 05:33.340
When we come back, the next video, we're going to create a cluster lip service for posts and one for

05:33.340 --> 05:34.570
event plus as well.
