00:01.300 --> 00:05.560
Hopefully you have now successfully installed scaffold to make sure that it is installed successfully.

00:05.590 --> 00:08.650
I'm going to open up my terminal and just run the command scaffold.

00:09.620 --> 00:13.080
If you run that command, you should see a bunch of help information like this right here.

00:13.100 --> 00:17.210
If you see something that says command not recognized, well, you need to double check your scaffold

00:17.210 --> 00:18.110
installation.

00:18.980 --> 00:23.480
Now that we've got scaffold installed, we are going to configure it by writing out yet another config

00:23.480 --> 00:24.140
file.

00:24.170 --> 00:29.360
This config file is going to tell scaffold how to manage all the different subprojects inside of our

00:29.360 --> 00:29.960
cluster.

00:30.890 --> 00:35.030
Inside of my code editor, I'm going to find my root project directory and I'm going to create a new

00:35.030 --> 00:38.030
file inside there called Scaffold Dot HTML.

00:39.080 --> 00:42.380
The config that we're going to write inside of here is going to look rather similar to a lot of the

00:42.380 --> 00:46.340
configuration that we've already written to apply to a Kubernetes cluster.

00:46.490 --> 00:49.990
But everything we write inside of here does not get applied to Kubernetes.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.550
Instead, it is just consumed by scaffold directly.

00:52.550 --> 00:56.060
And scaffold is a tool that runs outside of our cluster.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.970
So let's start to write out some configuration.

01:00.390 --> 01:03.360
A lot of these scaffold files we're going to write are going to be just about identical.

01:03.360 --> 01:07.920
So this is another scenario where you pretty much just learn it once and then start to kind of copy

01:07.920 --> 01:09.810
paste stuff around when appropriate.

01:10.540 --> 01:10.810
All right.

01:10.810 --> 01:16.450
So we're going to write out API version Scaffold V2, Alpha three.

01:17.530 --> 01:19.870
I'm going to put in a kind of config.

01:21.160 --> 01:27.070
A deploy with a nested cube, CTL, a nested manifest.

01:27.430 --> 01:33.920
And then we're going to put in an array entry, which means a little dash and then dot slash infra a

01:34.480 --> 01:35.200
star.

01:36.690 --> 01:41.400
So this first little bit of config right here or this really is our first important piece of config

01:41.400 --> 01:42.450
is what I should say.

01:42.900 --> 01:48.810
This is telling scaffold that there is a collection of different config files intended for Kubernetes

01:48.810 --> 01:51.150
inside of the infra aids directory.

01:51.780 --> 01:56.820
So by adding in this manifest line, we are telling scaffold that we want it to watch all of these different

01:56.820 --> 01:57.840
YAML files.

01:58.410 --> 02:04.140
Any time that we make a change to one of those files, Scaffold is going to automatically reapply that

02:04.140 --> 02:06.240
config file to our Kubernetes cluster.

02:06.240 --> 02:12.060
So in other words, it's going to save us from the hassle of having to run up CTL Apply F over and over

02:12.060 --> 02:15.840
and over again any time that we create a file or make a change to a file.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.560
By listing out manifests.

02:19.280 --> 02:24.740
Scaffold is also going to make sure to create all these or apply all these any time that we start scaffold

02:24.740 --> 02:25.160
up.

02:25.310 --> 02:30.770
It's also going to delete all the config or all the objects associated with these config files whenever

02:30.770 --> 02:32.180
we stop scaffold as well.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.380
So in total, this is really doing three things.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.890
When we start up scaffold, apply these files.

02:37.220 --> 02:41.840
When we make a change, apply these files whenever we stop scaffold.

02:42.260 --> 02:45.890
Find all the objects related to these config files and delete them.

02:45.890 --> 02:47.240
Don't delete the files themselves.

02:47.240 --> 02:51.020
Just delete the objects that are created by them inside of our Kubernetes cluster.

02:51.590 --> 02:55.730
This is really the part where this is fantastic for working between different projects, because whenever

02:55.730 --> 02:58.550
we start up scaffold, we're going to apply all these objects.

02:58.550 --> 03:03.350
Whenever we stop scaffold to go work on another project, all the objects related to these will be deleted

03:03.350 --> 03:05.900
and we'll end up with a relatively clean cluster.

03:06.990 --> 03:07.230
Okay.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.090
So that's part one of our config file.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.530
Now on to step two.

03:10.560 --> 03:15.270
We're going to put in a build local push of false.

03:16.020 --> 03:21.240
So by default, whenever scaffold makes a change to one of our images or rebuilds an image, it's going

03:21.240 --> 03:25.770
to try to push it up to Docker Hub that is not actually required when we're using scaffold.

03:25.770 --> 03:29.220
So we're going to disable that default behavior with the setting right here.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.470
Next up is artifacts.

03:34.030 --> 03:35.330
And I got a typo in there.

03:35.350 --> 03:36.190
Artifacts.

03:36.190 --> 03:37.510
Make sure you got the right spelling.

03:38.690 --> 03:40.010
This is going to be an array.

03:40.040 --> 03:43.220
We're going to write out one array entry and we'll discuss what it is doing.

03:43.670 --> 03:49.880
I'm going to put in image of my Docker ID, so for you it should be your dock ID slash client.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.620
Well, then put in a context of client.

03:54.740 --> 04:01.100
I'll put in Docker with nested Docker file and the value of that is going to be a Docker file with a

04:01.100 --> 04:02.300
capital D.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.050
I'll then put in sync.

04:06.870 --> 04:07.740
Manual.

04:08.570 --> 04:09.770
An array entry.

04:10.860 --> 04:18.030
A source that is going to be a string of Z star star star DJs.

04:19.110 --> 04:22.560
With a DST or destination of period.

04:23.820 --> 04:24.060
Okay.

04:24.060 --> 04:25.290
So what does this all about?

04:25.530 --> 04:30.960
Let's artefact section is telling scaffold about something inside of our project that it needs to maintain.

04:31.230 --> 04:36.810
We're essentially saying that there is going to be some pod that is running code out of the client directory

04:36.810 --> 04:38.010
inside of our project.

04:38.730 --> 04:41.130
So in this case, client directory right here.

04:42.050 --> 04:48.410
Whenever something changes inside this directory, scaffold is going to try to take those changes and

04:48.410 --> 04:50.180
somehow update our pod.

04:50.450 --> 04:53.330
There are two ways in which scaffold is going to try to update our pod.

04:53.720 --> 04:59.270
First off, if we make a change to a JavaScript file as indicated by this little matcher right here,

04:59.270 --> 05:04.610
if we make a change to a JavaScript file, then scaffold is going to try to take that change file and

05:04.610 --> 05:06.960
just directly throw it into our pod.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.450
It's going to literally take that file.

05:08.450 --> 05:11.450
We update it and copy it directly into the pod itself.

05:11.450 --> 05:14.600
So our pod is going to always have the latest code inside of it.

05:15.200 --> 05:20.780
If we ever make a change to anything inside this client directory that is not matched up by this CRC

05:20.780 --> 05:26.300
or this entire little rule right here, then scaffold is going to instead try to rebuild the entire

05:26.300 --> 05:26.930
image.

05:27.410 --> 05:31.870
So for example, imagine if we installed a new dependency into our client project.

05:31.880 --> 05:36.740
Whenever we install a new dependency that's going to update our package JSON file, technically package

05:36.740 --> 05:38.660
lock and technically node modules as well.

05:38.660 --> 05:43.100
But basically it is making a change to our project that is not changing a JavaScript file.

05:43.520 --> 05:48.230
So because we made a change to a file that is not matching up to this little matcher right here, scaffold

05:48.230 --> 05:53.690
is going to decide to completely rebuild our image and update the deployment tied to it.

05:54.950 --> 05:56.540
So it's going to rebuild this image.

05:56.570 --> 06:00.540
It's going to use this client directory as the source of the image.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.370
Then once the image is built, it's going to throw it as the update into our cluster.

06:05.150 --> 06:08.090
So those are the two things that this big rule right here is really doing.

06:08.090 --> 06:13.220
Either update these files in place or if it's a different file, rebuild the entire image.

06:14.140 --> 06:19.000
So we're now going to go through and essentially duplicate this rule for all of our other little sub

06:19.000 --> 06:20.140
projects inside of here.

06:20.140 --> 06:24.280
So for comments, event bus moderation posts and query.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.920
I'm going to copy this rule rather than just rewrite all of it.

06:30.490 --> 06:34.320
Now, when you copy this stuff, you might have a little bit of automatic formatting kick in.

06:34.330 --> 06:35.320
I definitely did.

06:35.990 --> 06:36.910
Oh, let's see.

06:36.910 --> 06:42.250
So if you get that automatic formatting and you tried to fix the indentation, just make sure you don't

06:42.250 --> 06:45.190
mess up any of the previous stuff, as I just did right there.

06:46.880 --> 06:47.960
We should have something like this.

06:47.990 --> 06:51.660
We should see dashed image and then dash the image down there.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.510
Make sure you got the right indentation as well.

06:54.110 --> 06:56.780
So now we will update this block for the comments.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.800
So this image is called your Docker ID slash comments.

07:00.830 --> 07:03.530
The context is comments, same docker file.

07:03.530 --> 07:06.910
But in this case, our file synching is going to be a little bit different.

07:06.920 --> 07:11.390
Remember, only the React application had an RC directory, everything else.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.090
So say comments, moderation, etc..

07:14.750 --> 07:16.010
No CRC directory.

07:16.010 --> 07:21.200
We only have a direct indexed JS file inside there, so we will update that little selector to be just

07:21.200 --> 07:22.940
start edges like so.

07:23.890 --> 07:25.810
So make sure you get that update on CRC.

07:26.570 --> 07:29.300
And then we're going to once again copy this thing.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.380
I'll make sure I fix up the indentation.

07:39.580 --> 07:40.300
Here we go.

07:41.380 --> 07:43.450
So again, makes you get the correct indentation.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.860
And on this next one, we'll update for event bus.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.030
So update one update to.

07:53.450 --> 07:53.780
Okay.

07:53.810 --> 07:54.440
Next one.

07:54.440 --> 07:58.310
I'll do another paste in a fix my indentation again.

08:01.650 --> 08:03.030
There's event bus right above.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.980
Here's the copy paste I just put in.

08:05.010 --> 08:10.950
This one I will make for this one I'm going to make for moderation.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.260
I will do yet another mix up the indentation.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.450
Again, I'm not going to tell you to fix the indentation this time.

08:19.450 --> 08:22.600
I'm sure you understand that probably has to be done.

08:23.390 --> 08:24.500
So we took care of moderation.

08:24.500 --> 08:29.420
We're on to posts and posts and just one more.

08:30.350 --> 08:31.400
I'll paste in.

08:33.190 --> 08:34.390
That indentation.

08:36.530 --> 08:39.640
And this last one is query and query.

08:39.650 --> 08:42.410
So at this point, I really encourage you to do a double check.

08:42.560 --> 08:45.860
We should have inside this array one.

08:46.710 --> 08:47.280
To.

08:48.270 --> 08:48.840
Three.

08:49.560 --> 08:55.230
For five and six blocks, they should be all in the same indentation level.

08:56.050 --> 08:59.110
Double check all the image names and the context name as well.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.690
So I have going in order from top to bottom.

09:01.690 --> 09:05.290
Client comments, event plus moderation posts and query.

09:06.360 --> 09:06.660
All right.

09:06.660 --> 09:10.590
I apologize for the long video, but that is it for our scaffold HTML file setup.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.090
So let's take a pause right here.

09:12.090 --> 09:16.470
We're going to make use of scaffold in the next video and see how it really improves our development

09:16.470 --> 09:17.130
workflow.
