00:01.820 --> 00:05.240
We've now created a cluster IP service for the event bus and for posts.

00:05.270 --> 00:07.840
It's now it's time for us to wire it all up.

00:07.850 --> 00:10.130
But what do I really mean by that step right there?

00:10.160 --> 00:11.930
Well, let's go back to our code editor.

00:11.930 --> 00:14.210
I want to open up our post project once again.

00:14.210 --> 00:17.420
And I just want to give you a quick reminder about some code that we wrote inside there.

00:17.930 --> 00:22.640
So back inside, my editor, I will find the post project and the indexed JS file inside.

00:23.180 --> 00:26.600
I'm then going to scroll down a little bit to where we were creating a new post.

00:27.140 --> 00:33.050
Right after we created a post, we then made a request out to our event bus and remember to access our

00:33.050 --> 00:33.710
event bus.

00:33.710 --> 00:37.730
We had to use a URL of localhost 4005.

00:38.430 --> 00:43.860
This exact URL right here only worked correctly when we were running the event bus on our local machine

00:43.860 --> 00:45.960
and not inside of, say, Kubernetes.

00:45.990 --> 00:49.560
Kubernetes right now technically is on our local machine, but you know what I mean?

00:50.280 --> 00:56.160
So we can no longer reach out to local host 4005 to get at our event bus, we have to replace this URL

00:56.160 --> 00:57.630
with some new URL.

00:58.050 --> 00:59.820
So what is that new URL going to be?

01:00.060 --> 01:04.050
Well, let's take a look at a diagram that's just going to give you a quick reminder on what our current

01:04.050 --> 01:05.010
setup looks like.

01:05.490 --> 01:06.900
So this is what we are doing right now.

01:06.900 --> 01:11.640
We've got our pod for posts, pod for event bus, and we've got a cluster IP service for each.

01:12.210 --> 01:18.870
So we need to figure out how we're going to reach over and make a request to this cluster IP service

01:18.870 --> 01:24.360
and hopefully that thing will forward the request on to the event bus that we want to make a request

01:24.360 --> 01:26.450
over to that cluster IP service.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.980
What is the URL we are going to type in?

01:29.520 --> 01:35.190
The URL that we're going to type in is going to be equal to the name of that cluster IP service.

01:36.580 --> 01:41.170
The exact name of that cluster IP service we can retrieve by going back over to our terminal and doing

01:41.170 --> 01:43.570
a CTL get services.

01:44.050 --> 01:47.620
So the exact name is Event Bus CRV.

01:48.330 --> 01:56.280
So if we want to reach out to the event bus service service, we are going to make a request to HTTP,

01:56.610 --> 01:59.100
event bus, CRV.

01:59.760 --> 02:00.540
And that's it.

02:01.220 --> 02:04.640
That's how we reach out from one pod to another service.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.380
We just put in HTTP.

02:06.410 --> 02:09.560
Then the exact name of the service we want to reach out to.

02:10.300 --> 02:14.860
Naturally, if we are trying to make a request to a very specific port, we will add that on as well.

02:15.010 --> 02:18.840
So our event bus service is listing for traffic on port 4005.

02:18.850 --> 02:22.900
So we would put on Colon 4005 on the very end as well.

02:27.120 --> 02:31.800
The same exact thing is true if our event bus is trying to reach out to the cluster IP service that

02:31.800 --> 02:33.630
is pointing at all of our postpaid.

02:34.210 --> 02:39.010
So our service that's governing all those post pods is posts, cluster IP.

02:40.510 --> 02:43.780
So this is post cluster IP.

02:45.550 --> 02:50.500
So if you want our event bus to reach out to that service, it would make a request to.

02:53.330 --> 02:59.870
Both Lester IP, CRV and then the appropriate port, which in this case is 4000.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.000
And so that would be going from over here.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.930
Down to that service.

03:08.450 --> 03:09.400
That's pretty much it.

03:10.530 --> 03:15.480
So the takeaway here is that any time that we want to have some communication between pods, we're always

03:15.480 --> 03:18.930
going to create a cluster IP service for the pod we're trying to reach out to.

03:18.960 --> 03:25.350
Once we have created that cluster IP service to make a request to it, we're going to write in a URL

03:25.380 --> 03:28.050
of HTTP and then the name of the service.

03:30.180 --> 03:34.350
So back on this diagram, when I said wire it all up, I pretty much just mean we need to go around

03:34.350 --> 03:37.110
inside of our index file in the post project.

03:37.110 --> 03:41.970
And any time we try to reach out to our event bus, we need to replace local host with the name of the

03:41.970 --> 03:43.950
service for the event bus.

03:44.340 --> 03:46.770
And the same is true of our event bus as well.

03:46.800 --> 03:52.500
If we open up our event bus indexed JS file, remember inside of here we are trying to make requests

03:52.500 --> 03:54.120
to localhost 4000.

03:54.150 --> 03:57.510
So rather than putting local host right there, we'll put the name of the service that we are trying

03:57.510 --> 03:58.470
to reach out to.

04:00.430 --> 04:00.720
Okay.

04:00.730 --> 04:02.790
Let's start making these changes in the next video.

04:02.800 --> 04:08.020
After we make these changes will then rebuild our images and update our deployments so that they are

04:08.020 --> 04:09.310
running this new code.
