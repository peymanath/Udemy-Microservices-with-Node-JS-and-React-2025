Two videos ago, you might have seen me very quickly write out a command as they get pods as opposed

00:07.170 --> 00:07.720
to cubes.

00:07.740 --> 00:08.970
It'll get pods.

00:09.180 --> 00:10.440
Now, if you run, kay, get pause.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.650
Right now, I could just about guarantee you're going to get an error.

00:12.660 --> 00:15.900
Something that says Unknown Command K or something very similar.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.310
Let me tell you a little bit more about this shortcut.

00:18.330 --> 00:19.890
This is something that I do personally.

00:19.890 --> 00:23.700
You're going to see very few other people do this, but it's something I found that it's really effective

00:23.700 --> 00:27.480
just to save my self a tiny little bit of time every single day.

00:28.220 --> 00:31.100
I found that writing out the word CTL is just a little bit annoying.

00:31.100 --> 00:34.700
I make typos in it all the time, and that's just annoying.

00:34.700 --> 00:35.540
I don't want to do it.

00:35.870 --> 00:43.400
So instead I set up an alias on my computer, but any time I write out K it will be automatically translated

00:43.400 --> 00:43.980
into Cube.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.630
CTL For me, the exact process of how you do this is going to vary based upon your personal computer

00:50.630 --> 00:51.230
setup.

00:51.740 --> 00:54.500
So I personally use a shell called Z Shell.

00:54.530 --> 00:58.880
That means that the program that is running inside of my terminal and interpreting the commands that

00:58.880 --> 01:03.410
I run in or I type in that command or that program is called Z Shell.

01:03.950 --> 01:06.650
You might be using something called Bash instead.

01:06.860 --> 01:07.820
I don't really know.

01:07.820 --> 01:10.760
It really comes down to what you are doing on your local machine.

01:10.760 --> 01:14.480
So in setting up this alias, you are going to have to do a little bit of research.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.670
Let me show you how I do it on Z Shell.

01:17.710 --> 01:23.560
So I would open up inside my code editor, my z shell RC file if you are running bash it would probably

01:23.560 --> 01:25.030
be bash RC instead.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.080
So I can open that up.

01:29.080 --> 01:33.820
And inside of here I got a little bit of shell configuration and then a list of different aliases.

01:33.820 --> 01:38.110
So these are commands that I could type in to my terminal, and they will be automatically expanded

01:38.110 --> 01:39.430
into something else instead.

01:39.730 --> 01:43.250
But for me, I write an alias K equals Q CTL.

01:43.270 --> 01:46.600
So again, anytime I put in K, it'll be expanded automatically.

01:47.050 --> 01:52.510
I've also got a little shortcut for Docker PS as well, so I can type in just DPS and that will list

01:52.510 --> 01:56.010
out all my running terminals or all assuming all my running console containers.

01:56.020 --> 01:57.680
So many pieces of terminology here.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.740
It will list out all my different running containers.

02:00.920 --> 02:05.030
So again, you might see me throughout the course writing out just kay, if you ever see me.

02:05.030 --> 02:05.280
Right.

02:05.300 --> 02:05.560
Kay.

02:05.570 --> 02:09.830
I do not mean to in this course, I mean to show you the exact command every single time.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.580
But every now and then, if I'm trying to do something very quickly, I might accidentally fall back

02:13.580 --> 02:14.720
to writing out Kay instead.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.250
And if I do, so my apologies.

02:16.670 --> 02:20.540
I do recommend you try out this little alias on your own if you can figure out how to set it up because

02:20.540 --> 02:22.250
it is just a nice little time saver.

02:22.760 --> 02:23.480
Okay, so that's it.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.340
That's all I want to discuss here.

02:25.340 --> 02:26.540
Continue in just a minute.
