00:01.080 --> 00:03.990
In this video, we're going to go through a little bit of Kubernetes set up.

00:03.990 --> 00:08.640
As a quick reminder, Kubernetes is a tool for running a bunch of different containers together.

00:08.940 --> 00:13.260
It will automatically manage the creation and management of all these different containers.

00:13.260 --> 00:17.700
And it's also going to make it really easy for us to communicate between these containers as well.

00:18.270 --> 00:20.430
So let's go through some setup in this video.

00:21.740 --> 00:23.650
There's two possibilities right now for setup.

00:23.660 --> 00:29.510
Either you are running Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac, or you are running Docker Toolbox or Linux.

00:30.250 --> 00:34.270
You will know that you're running Docker for Mac or Windows if you have that little icon up here inside

00:34.270 --> 00:35.180
of your system tray.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.720
Or of course, if you're on windows, it'll probably be down on your bottom.

00:37.720 --> 00:38.260
Right.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.500
If you're running either of those, then I got good news for you.

00:41.530 --> 00:44.050
Kubernetes setup is really easy and straightforward.

00:44.290 --> 00:45.370
It's so easy and straightforward.

00:45.370 --> 00:48.070
They'll just do it right now in the span of about 10 seconds.

00:48.070 --> 00:51.340
So even if you're running Docker Toolbox or Linux, just stick around for a moment.

00:51.640 --> 00:56.170
So if you're on Docker for Mac or Windows, we will find that Docker system tray icon.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.090
You'll find preferences.

00:59.340 --> 01:02.100
You'll see a window like disappear on the side.

01:02.100 --> 01:06.330
We'll find Kubernetes, and then we'll just click on Enable Kubernetes.

01:07.150 --> 01:07.690
On the bottom.

01:07.690 --> 01:07.870
Right.

01:07.870 --> 01:09.280
We'll find, apply and restart.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.410
And that is pretty much it.

01:14.220 --> 01:17.880
Well, if you got through that process, then you could pause this video right now and continue in the

01:17.880 --> 01:18.660
next video.

01:18.870 --> 01:23.190
Otherwise, if you are running Duck or Toolbox or Linux, stay around for just a moment.

01:23.790 --> 01:25.140
Now, I got some bad news for you.

01:25.140 --> 01:29.670
Unfortunately, the setup, if you're running Docker Toolbox or Linux is just a little bit more complicated.

01:29.970 --> 01:32.970
You are going to have to install a tool called Mini Cube.

01:33.240 --> 01:37.800
Mini Cube is a tool that will start up a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.040
There is a link to the documentation right here.

01:41.340 --> 01:46.770
Do be aware that the exact location of this documentation has changed more than once over the years.

01:46.770 --> 01:51.090
So if you try going to this link right here and it doesn't work for any reason, that's okay.

01:51.120 --> 01:55.680
Just do a google search for install mini cube and you will probably find some directions on how to do

01:55.680 --> 01:56.070
it.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.010
So I'm going to assume that that link is going to work.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.710
So I'm going to copy it and hop on over.

02:03.570 --> 02:06.330
So on this page you can scroll down to installing Mini Cube.

02:06.930 --> 02:10.500
You will find directions for Linux, macOS or Windows.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.650
For each of these, you'll go ahead and walk through the directions.

02:14.890 --> 02:16.230
Now, I've got to be honest with you.

02:16.240 --> 02:22.180
If you're using Docker Toolbox, the reality of the situation here is that Docker toolbox is not super

02:22.180 --> 02:22.750
stable.

02:22.780 --> 02:25.180
There's a billion things that can go wrong with it.

02:25.180 --> 02:30.580
So I got to be honest with you, if you run into installation problems with Docker Toolbox, I'm going

02:30.580 --> 02:32.920
to leave it up to you to do some troubleshooting.

02:33.220 --> 02:38.080
I have gone through so much troubleshooting with Docker Toolbox in the past and it's something that

02:38.080 --> 02:42.410
is very ineffective for me to try to help you with over Q&amp;A discussion boards.

02:42.430 --> 02:47.350
There's just so many things that can be different between your system and my possible system, my kind

02:47.350 --> 02:52.630
of reference computer I have for running Docker Toolbox that I just really cannot effectively support

02:52.630 --> 02:55.390
you if something goes wrong with the mini cube installation.

02:55.870 --> 03:00.640
So again, if you're using Docker Toolbox, you're going to have to figure a little bit out of this

03:00.640 --> 03:01.570
stuff on your own.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.920
There are a tremendous number of resources out there that you can use to kind of do some research and

03:05.920 --> 03:06.940
figure out what's going on.

03:07.680 --> 03:08.010
All right.

03:08.010 --> 03:11.760
So I'm sorry to have to say that, but again, it's kind of the reality situation.

03:12.120 --> 03:16.260
So hopefully you can get mini cubes set up successfully once you do.

03:16.290 --> 03:19.380
Pause right here and we'll join back up together in just a moment.
