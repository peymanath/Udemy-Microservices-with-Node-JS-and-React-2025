WEBVTT

00:00.940 --> 00:02.410
We've now created a deployment.

00:02.410 --> 00:06.490
So now we're going to take a look at a couple of commands we can use to inspect that deployment and

00:06.490 --> 00:08.050
manipulate it in some fashion.

00:08.440 --> 00:11.980
The first command we're going to take a look at is it'll get deployments.

00:11.980 --> 00:15.550
That's going to list out all the running deployments we have on our cluster.

00:16.400 --> 00:22.490
So I'll do a little bit deployments and we'll see that we have one deployment called Post Dash Depot.

00:24.020 --> 00:30.620
On here is a red number up to date and available ready is the number of pods that we are trying to create.

00:30.620 --> 00:33.800
So that's the number on the right of the little slash right there.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.910
And then on the left hand side is the number of pods that are up and running and ready to receive some

00:37.910 --> 00:39.350
traffic or do some work.

00:40.130 --> 00:44.870
We've also got the number of up to date pods because remember, we use deployments to manage updating

00:44.870 --> 00:50.060
the versions of some code or application running inside these pods and then the number of pods that

00:50.060 --> 00:52.790
are available and again, ready to do some work for us.

00:54.870 --> 00:58.730
Of course, we can also now print out the pods we have running inside of our cluster as well.

00:58.740 --> 01:05.610
We should see one pod that has been created automatically by this deployment so we can do a to get pods.

01:06.150 --> 01:09.660
And right there is the pod that was created by our deployment.

01:10.020 --> 01:14.820
Now, very interestingly, if you and I tried to delete this pod that was created by the deployment,

01:14.820 --> 01:18.300
the deployment is going to see that that pod has mysteriously disappeared.

01:18.300 --> 01:21.030
And so it's going to attempt to recreate the pod for us.

01:21.330 --> 01:22.770
Let's try doing that right now.

01:23.250 --> 01:28.740
I'm going to delete that pod that was created by the deployment with a cube CTL delete.

01:28.770 --> 01:29.370
Odd.

01:30.110 --> 01:31.670
And then I'll put in the name of the pod.

01:31.670 --> 01:33.740
So I'm going to copy paste that name right there.

01:35.120 --> 01:39.080
Remember the first post right there, just as a reminder, that is the pod that we created in the last

01:39.080 --> 01:41.510
couple of videos when we were working with pods initially.

01:42.390 --> 01:43.770
All right, so I'll delete that pod.

01:45.310 --> 01:46.810
I'm going to have to wait a second or two.

01:48.030 --> 01:51.570
And after that command is completed, we can then get our pods again.

01:52.940 --> 01:53.780
And you'll notice.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.320
Wait a minute.

01:54.320 --> 01:55.820
We've still got two pods.

01:55.910 --> 01:57.590
Well, not quite.

01:57.620 --> 02:01.190
Take a look at the exact name of the pod that we just deleted.

02:01.220 --> 02:06.710
It was post double, then some ID and then some other part of an ID and then take a look at the next

02:06.710 --> 02:07.610
one down here.

02:07.820 --> 02:10.850
You'll notice that the last part of that ID is completely different.

02:10.940 --> 02:14.810
In addition, the age of this pod right here is only 11 seconds.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.420
So the instant we deleted the old pod.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.220
Our deployment automatically created a new one for us.

02:21.460 --> 02:26.320
So I think you can start to see how using deployments to manage some workloads inside of our application

02:26.320 --> 02:27.770
are really fantastic.

02:27.790 --> 02:30.760
If anything starts to go wrong, well, Kubernetes has our back.

02:30.760 --> 02:33.790
It's going to automatically try to repair our application.

02:35.350 --> 02:36.640
Now a couple more commands here.

02:36.910 --> 02:39.250
First off is to describe deployment.

02:39.430 --> 02:42.790
So we can use this to print out some information about a specific deployment.

02:42.790 --> 02:46.960
And again, we're going to usually do this any time that we're trying to debug a deployment and figure

02:46.960 --> 02:48.490
out why it's not working correctly.

02:49.420 --> 02:53.890
So we can do a little describe deployment.

02:53.890 --> 02:55.720
And then the name of our deployment was back up.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.640
Here is Post Dash Depot.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.770
So you can see there is once again a lot of gibberish information here.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.960
Over time, a lot of this stuff will start to make sense.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.480
But right now, well, it's just a lot of information.

03:09.110 --> 03:11.630
Again, the most important part is the events down here.

03:11.630 --> 03:14.630
It's going to tell you about what is going on inside of your deployment.

03:16.840 --> 03:22.150
Next up, we can create a deployment out of a config file using that same QC to apply F command.

03:22.490 --> 03:30.190
And finally, if we need to delete a deployment, yep, it'll delete deployment so we can do a CTL delete

03:30.190 --> 03:31.090
deployment.

03:32.210 --> 03:34.010
Of post double.

03:34.160 --> 03:38.870
As soon as we delete that deployment, all the associated pods are going to be deleted as well.

03:39.080 --> 03:44.930
So I should be able to do a little get pods and I'll see that I don't have any pod related to that deployment

03:44.930 --> 03:45.920
running anymore.

03:46.130 --> 03:50.570
So the instant the deployment goes away, all the associated pods disappear as well.

03:51.140 --> 03:56.390
I can then recreate the deployment with the ETL apply chef post dash double.

03:58.490 --> 04:01.340
Then I'll get my deployments again.

04:01.670 --> 04:01.970
Yep.

04:01.970 --> 04:02.720
There it is.

04:04.550 --> 04:05.630
And my pods.

04:05.990 --> 04:07.730
And there's the pod created by the deployment.

04:08.440 --> 04:08.830
Cool.

04:09.850 --> 04:13.600
Now, while we're looking at our list of plots here, I'm going to delete that old pod that we had created

04:13.600 --> 04:15.520
manually from a couple of videos ago.

04:15.520 --> 04:21.640
So I'm going to do a little delete pod pose again just to get rid of that thing, because we usually

04:21.640 --> 04:26.620
do not create pods manually because if they crash for any reason, then we don't have anything to start

04:26.620 --> 04:27.340
them back up.

04:28.770 --> 04:31.500
And once that's deleted, very good.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.940
We'll go ahead and take a pause right here.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.760
One last thing I want to show you around deployments in just a moment.
