00:01.360 --> 00:05.620
Now that I've told you a ton about config files without actually saying, well, what they're really

00:05.620 --> 00:08.890
doing internally, let's go ahead and create our first config file.

00:08.890 --> 00:12.910
In this first config file, we are going to try to create a pod directly.

00:12.910 --> 00:18.700
So just a pod by itself out of our post service though, just to look back at this diagram over here,

00:18.820 --> 00:24.940
the only part of this thing that I really want to make out of everything we discussed is just one pod.

00:26.870 --> 00:27.900
Like that right there.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.530
That's all they want to have a pod that's running container.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.330
There's not going to be any other service.

00:32.330 --> 00:33.530
There's not going to be any deployment.

00:33.560 --> 00:34.250
Nothing like that.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.690
Just a pod by itself.

00:35.990 --> 00:37.800
So let's figure out how we will do this.

00:37.820 --> 00:41.240
In this video, we're going to write out all the configuration for it, and we'll have a deep discussion

00:41.240 --> 00:43.760
about what every line of this configuration really means.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.430
To get started, we're going to first go back to our terminal.

00:47.620 --> 00:52.360
We will change into our post directory and we are going to rebuild that Docker image.

00:52.370 --> 00:56.300
Now, it's really important that you rebuild this thing because we're going to apply a additional label

00:56.300 --> 00:59.930
to it that's going to help us identify it inside the configuration that we're about to write.

00:59.930 --> 01:03.320
So even though we've built it several times now in the last couple of videos, yeah, we're going to

01:03.320 --> 01:04.190
build it again.

01:04.580 --> 01:08.270
So inside of posts I'm going to run Docker Build.

01:09.030 --> 01:16.530
Dashti and then we'll put down your Docker ID slash posts and then I call in and I'll throw a version

01:16.530 --> 01:17.250
number on there.

01:17.250 --> 01:19.260
So I'll use 00.1.

01:19.260 --> 01:20.460
Don't forget the call in.

01:21.230 --> 01:25.700
I'll then put a space and put in the dot to say I want to build this image out of this current directory

01:25.700 --> 01:26.480
of posts.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.180
And there we go.

01:29.180 --> 01:33.710
So I've now built that image and that's how we can refer to this exact image.

01:33.710 --> 01:37.640
We've got the name of the image or the tag along with the version number right there on the very end.

01:37.970 --> 01:40.370
So now that we've got that put together, let's go back over to our editor.

01:40.370 --> 01:45.050
We're going to write out our configuration file to create a pod using this container or this image.

01:45.930 --> 01:50.580
The back of my editor, I'm going to first create a new directory called Infra.

01:51.210 --> 01:52.860
This is short for infrastructure.

01:52.860 --> 01:58.080
So this is going to contain all the configuration, all the code related to the deployment or management

01:58.080 --> 02:00.930
of all of our different services inside there.

02:00.930 --> 02:03.680
And then going to create a folder called K Eights.

02:04.440 --> 02:06.810
We're going to eventually have several different folders inside of here.

02:06.930 --> 02:11.850
Right now, we're just going to say K AIDS is going to contain all of our Kubernetes configuration files.

02:11.850 --> 02:15.480
Just, you know, k8s is short for Kubernetes.

02:17.560 --> 02:22.750
Inside there, I'll create a new file and we're going to call this thing post YAML.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.430
All right, so inside of here.

02:26.440 --> 02:26.770
Yep.

02:26.770 --> 02:28.790
That's what we're going to write out, all of our configuration.

02:28.810 --> 02:32.920
Now, as I mentioned at the start, this video, we're just going to focus on writing out the configuration

02:32.920 --> 02:34.770
and creating this pod.

02:34.780 --> 02:38.410
Then we'll come back the next video and discuss exactly what all the config is actually doing.

02:38.410 --> 02:42.370
So for right now, we're going to do a little bit of a follow along, write out exactly what I write

02:42.370 --> 02:42.880
out.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.030
So we'll say API version with a capital V.

02:48.190 --> 02:49.690
A colon and then v one.

02:50.830 --> 02:54.340
But in a kind of pod notice that pod has a capital P.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.870
Put in metadata.

02:57.850 --> 02:59.260
Well, then put in a new line.

02:59.260 --> 03:04.660
And on the next slide there has to be one indentation that like so the really two spaces right there.

03:04.810 --> 03:09.250
If you don't have that, then you're not running out valid yaml so make sure you've got exactly two

03:09.250 --> 03:10.030
spaces.

03:11.090 --> 03:12.890
We'll write out name is posts.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.510
Then back at the top level of indentation, we'll put down speck.

03:18.380 --> 03:19.580
We will indent again.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.210
And say containers.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.590
Another new line.

03:24.770 --> 03:26.470
We're going to indent one more level.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.410
We'll put in a dash space name of posts.

03:31.620 --> 03:37.070
Then image will be whatever the image is that you just built 2 seconds ago back at your terminal.

03:37.070 --> 03:38.660
So essentially that right there.

03:38.990 --> 03:44.030
So for me, it will be Stephen Greider slash post colon 001.

03:44.720 --> 03:49.010
Now it's absolutely critical that you have the exact same indentation that I do all the way through.

03:49.810 --> 03:54.370
If you save this in a try to run it, as we're about to do in a second and you get an error, I can

03:54.370 --> 03:57.670
just about guarantee you there is a typo somewhere inside of here.

03:59.290 --> 03:59.460
Okay.

03:59.470 --> 04:00.730
So that's our config file.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.550
We have told Kubernetes that we want to create a pod.

04:03.580 --> 04:05.370
We want its name to be posts.

04:05.380 --> 04:08.560
And inside that pod, we want there to be exactly one container.

04:08.980 --> 04:13.990
The containers name should be posts and we're going to build that container using the image of that

04:13.990 --> 04:14.650
right there.

04:15.260 --> 04:20.290
So now let's figure out how we can use the CTL command line tool to actually make use of this config

04:20.290 --> 04:20.830
file.

04:22.360 --> 04:27.040
Next, we're going to tell Kubernetes to use this config file to create a new object.

04:27.370 --> 04:29.590
But to do so, we're going to go back over to our terminal.

04:30.390 --> 04:31.230
Back at my terminal.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.590
I'm still inside of my post project directory.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.780
I want to change into that K AIDS folder that we just made a second ago.

04:37.140 --> 04:38.550
They'll go up one directory.

04:38.910 --> 04:41.460
I'll change into infra and then k.

04:42.990 --> 04:48.330
And then inside there I should see the post yaml file to tell Kubernetes that we wanted to use this

04:48.330 --> 04:48.950
config file.

04:48.960 --> 04:56.970
We'll write out cube, it'll apply F and then the name of the file, which in this case is post HTML.

04:58.540 --> 04:59.620
Well, go ahead and run that.

04:59.890 --> 05:01.960
And then we should see something like this right here.

05:02.290 --> 05:07.330
If you immediately see an error when you run that command again, I can guarantee you that you've got

05:07.330 --> 05:09.490
a typo somewhere inside this file.

05:09.880 --> 05:13.420
You will only ever see errors coming out of this command if there is a typo.

05:13.450 --> 05:17.180
There's just about no other scenario unless you're not running the Kubernetes cluster at all.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.180
That's the only two scenarios.

05:18.190 --> 05:21.940
Either Kubernetes is not running on your machine, or there's a typo inside the file.

05:23.370 --> 05:26.250
Well, it says that this thing was created, but what does that really mean?

05:26.940 --> 05:31.030
To inspect the state or to figure out exactly what is going on inside of our cluster?

05:31.050 --> 05:34.330
There is a variety of different commands we're going to run with CTL.

05:34.710 --> 05:39.370
In this case, we want to take a look at all the different pods that are running inside of our cluster.

05:39.390 --> 05:41.310
There should be exactly one right now.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.540
So to inspect and get a list of all the different pods that are running inside of here, we can run

05:45.540 --> 05:46.950
Kube CTL.

05:48.020 --> 05:49.550
Yet odds.

05:51.030 --> 05:53.940
And we'll see that there is exactly one pod with the name of posts.

05:54.330 --> 05:59.730
There's one copy of it that is been trying to be executed and one copy is successfully running.

06:00.210 --> 06:01.790
This pod status is running.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.160
It has never been restarted and it was created 50 seconds ago.

06:05.950 --> 06:06.370
So that's it.

06:06.370 --> 06:08.590
That's how we create an object in Kubernetes.

06:08.770 --> 06:14.560
Just about everything else we do with Kubernetes is going to be kind of variations of this config file.

06:15.340 --> 06:18.850
Normally the config files we're going to write out are going to be way longer than what you see right

06:18.850 --> 06:21.580
here, usually closer to, say, 40 lines or so.

06:21.970 --> 06:24.270
But this creates just one simple little object.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.680
We then applied it to Kubernetes and Kubernetes.

06:26.710 --> 06:29.980
Use this config to decide exactly what to do inside the cluster.

06:30.370 --> 06:33.520
Now, there's a lot of configuration, even though it's only a couple of lines that's kind of stuffed

06:33.520 --> 06:34.110
inside of here.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.990
So I want to give you a couple of quick notes about what's going on here and a couple of quick notes

06:37.990 --> 06:41.050
about the Cube CTL command line tool in just a moment.
