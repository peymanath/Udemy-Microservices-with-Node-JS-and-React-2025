00:00.910 --> 00:04.600
Now that we have seen the goal of this application, we're going to spend a couple of videos to go over

00:04.600 --> 00:06.190
the design of this app.

00:06.250 --> 00:10.390
We're going to first begin by discussing the different pieces of data that we're going to have to store

00:10.390 --> 00:11.980
in order to implement this thing.

00:12.370 --> 00:16.270
So in total, I think we are going to have four different types of resources.

00:16.510 --> 00:23.290
We're going to first have some table or collection, some storage of users as your guest is going to

00:23.290 --> 00:25.740
store all the different users who sign up to our application.

00:25.750 --> 00:29.740
And presumably along with each user, we will store their email and password.

00:30.250 --> 00:36.370
That's pretty much it for each user will then have some collection or table of tickets, and each of

00:36.370 --> 00:41.560
these records are going to represent one single ticket that someone is trying to buy or sell.

00:42.670 --> 00:43.510
For every ticket.

00:43.510 --> 00:48.430
We're going to allow it to have a title that's going to be a string, a price, which will be a number,

00:49.120 --> 00:54.670
a user ID reference, which is going to be a reference to the user who is trying to sell the ticket.

00:55.660 --> 00:58.030
And a reference to some order.

00:58.420 --> 00:59.860
Let's give you a order ID.

01:00.820 --> 01:06.550
And that order ID reference is going to be the kind of purchase attempt to actually get at this ticket.

01:07.620 --> 01:10.500
Or then going to have a collection or table of orders.

01:10.950 --> 01:16.110
So for each order that gets created, we're going to store the user ID of the person who is creating

01:16.110 --> 01:16.800
this order.

01:17.610 --> 01:18.900
The status of the order.

01:18.900 --> 01:24.570
So whether it is cancelled, whether we are waiting for payment to come in, whether it is 100% complete

01:24.570 --> 01:26.250
and some new person owns the ticket.

01:27.070 --> 01:29.140
We're going to store the ticket ID.

01:30.710 --> 01:35.360
And the time at which the order expires, because, remember, people only have 15 minutes or so or

01:35.360 --> 01:39.050
some configurable amount of time to actually purchase a ticket.

01:39.470 --> 01:44.470
Just to be really clear, this order represents the attempt to purchase a ticket.

01:44.480 --> 01:50.840
So the instant that a user clicks on that purchase button right there, we're going to create this order

01:50.840 --> 01:51.680
object.

01:51.710 --> 01:54.800
And the order object represents the intent to purchase the ticket.

01:56.260 --> 01:58.930
That expires, that will represent the 15 minutes.

01:59.170 --> 02:03.310
And as soon as the person actually enters in their credit card or what have you, we will update the

02:03.310 --> 02:07.330
order status to complete it or awaiting payment or something like that.

02:09.370 --> 02:12.010
And then finally we're going to have a charge object.

02:12.040 --> 02:17.770
This charge is going to represent our ability to actually charge some persons credit card and get some

02:17.770 --> 02:18.610
money out of them.

02:19.290 --> 02:24.900
So on the charge object, we'll have a reference to the order that user is trying to pay for the status

02:24.900 --> 02:25.530
of the charge.

02:25.530 --> 02:30.900
So whether it is created, failed or completed, the amount of money tied to the charge, and we'll

02:30.900 --> 02:35.070
also have two little maintenance fields or administrative fields on here as well.

02:35.070 --> 02:36.840
One is going to be a stripe ID.

02:36.930 --> 02:39.630
So again, we're going to be using Stripe to handle payments.

02:39.630 --> 02:44.850
Stripe ID is going to be a reference to some object over in the Stripe JS or the stripe world.

02:44.970 --> 02:47.670
That is going to be us trying to actually build someone's credit card.

02:48.270 --> 02:50.880
We're also going to have the ability to refund tickets as well.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.270
So we're going to have something called the Stripe refund ID on here too.

02:54.840 --> 02:58.050
At this point, I'm sure a lot of these different objects look completely foreign.

02:58.050 --> 03:00.930
You might be saying, what is the difference between a ticket and an order?

03:00.930 --> 03:02.940
What's the difference between an order and a charge?

03:02.940 --> 03:03.510
Don't worry.

03:03.510 --> 03:06.270
Over time you're going to see the purpose of each of these different objects.

03:06.270 --> 03:11.130
Right now, I just want to get these pieces of terminology out there and get you thinking about them.

03:11.940 --> 03:13.260
So that's a little design talk.

03:13.260 --> 03:17.280
Number one, we're going to go through another couple of videos just like these to give you some big

03:17.280 --> 03:20.640
overall picture, give you an idea of how we're going to put this thing together.

03:20.640 --> 03:21.420
So quick pause.

03:21.420 --> 03:22.860
Next one in just a moment.
