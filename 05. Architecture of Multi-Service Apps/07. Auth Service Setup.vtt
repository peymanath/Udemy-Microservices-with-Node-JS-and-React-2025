00:00.870 --> 00:04.580
All right, enough videos about the design or architecture of our application.

00:04.590 --> 00:06.210
Time to actually start writing some code.

00:06.360 --> 00:09.270
So in this video, we're going to start working on our off service.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.950
This service is going to be in charge of handling signup, signing in and so on.

00:14.340 --> 00:18.090
In total, our service is going to have four different routes assigned to it.

00:18.330 --> 00:23.400
So we'll have the ability to sign up with the post request, sign in with the post, sign out with the

00:23.400 --> 00:26.940
post, and also get information about the currently signed and user.

00:27.450 --> 00:29.640
So let's go back over to our terminal right away.

00:29.670 --> 00:31.920
We're going to start to generate some different files.

00:31.920 --> 00:37.710
We're going to do some NPM installation, get some modules, all that kind of stuff for our off service.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.040
So back at my terminal.

00:41.790 --> 00:44.130
I'm still inside my blog project directory.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.930
I'm going to change out of that folder.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.690
So I'm now back inside of a workspace directory.

00:48.810 --> 00:53.550
And inside of here I'm going to generate a new overall folder for all of our different services.

00:53.610 --> 00:55.140
I'm going to call this ticketing.

00:55.710 --> 00:58.410
That is the name of our project ticketing.

01:00.340 --> 01:04.000
Then inside of ticketing, I'll create a new directory of auth.

01:05.210 --> 01:06.350
And change into it.

01:07.410 --> 01:10.860
And then inside of this auth directory I'll run npm init.

01:11.370 --> 01:12.000
Why?

01:13.680 --> 01:15.600
There's our package chase on file.

01:16.080 --> 01:19.740
Then inside of here, we're going to first install a couple of different dependencies.

01:21.660 --> 01:26.490
I'm going to install TypeScript because remember, we are going to use TypeScript on this project.

01:26.820 --> 01:32.370
I'm going to get Node dev, which is a tool that we're going to use to actually execute our project

01:32.370 --> 01:33.840
in the development environment.

01:35.330 --> 01:36.830
I'm going to get express.

01:37.850 --> 01:40.910
I'll get at types express.

01:41.930 --> 01:44.050
And we'll just do that installation for right now.

01:44.060 --> 01:48.710
We will come back very shortly and add in many other dependencies into this project, but that's good

01:48.710 --> 01:49.850
enough to get started with.

01:51.310 --> 01:56.740
So while that is running and then going to open up my code editor inside of our overall project directory.

01:56.740 --> 01:57.940
So the ticketing folder.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.310
So it looks like that's all done.

02:00.310 --> 02:04.270
I'll change back out to ticketing and open up my code editor inside there.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.330
All right, so now I should see that off the project directory right there.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.250
There's our package JSON file.

02:13.110 --> 02:19.020
Then back at my terminal, I'm going to change into that directory one more time and I'm going to generate

02:19.020 --> 02:23.940
a config file inside of here with TSC dash dash in it.

02:25.600 --> 02:25.950
Cool.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.520
So that's enough to get started with.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.850
I'm going to go back over to my editor and we'll start writing out some code.

02:33.100 --> 02:37.550
Inside my art directory, I'm going to make a new folder called CRC.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.290
So you're going to start placing all of our code inside this CRC directory.

02:41.590 --> 02:47.020
I'm going to first begin by creating a apts or index to get started with file.

02:48.150 --> 02:49.770
Inside this indexed file.

02:49.800 --> 02:55.230
I'll then throw in some basic syntax and basic imports, all that kind of stuff to get an express application

02:55.230 --> 02:56.010
up and running.

02:56.550 --> 02:58.890
So I will do an import express.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.610
From Express.

03:03.070 --> 03:04.570
I'll then get my.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.010
JSON from body dash parser.

03:09.810 --> 03:11.370
I'm going to create a new app.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.050
Then I will associate the JSON middleware with it.

03:17.050 --> 03:20.230
So API use JSON.

03:21.650 --> 03:24.380
I'm not going to worry about setting up any handlers just yet.

03:24.710 --> 03:27.170
And so finally, I'll do an listen.

03:27.170 --> 03:30.140
And this time around, we're going to do a lesson on Port 3000.

03:30.140 --> 03:34.220
Remember, the port doesn't really make a difference once we start making use of Kubernetes, because

03:34.220 --> 03:36.350
we're going to start to create all these different services.

03:36.380 --> 03:41.570
A Kubernetes service that is that's going to govern access to this off thing that we're putting together.

03:41.870 --> 03:46.880
So right now, we'll just use a service sub 3000 because again, doesn't really make a big difference.

03:47.770 --> 03:49.720
And then I would will put in a callback.

03:49.720 --> 03:54.220
But the console log of listing on port 3000.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.330
Let's now go over to our package JSON file.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.590
We're going to set up a start script inside there.

04:02.160 --> 04:06.300
So inside of package JSON, I'm going to remove the test script.

04:06.630 --> 04:08.340
I'm going to replace it with START.

04:09.530 --> 04:14.390
And the command that we're going to run to start this thing up is dash node, dash dev.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.830
And we want to run source slash index.

04:18.030 --> 04:19.440
It's like so.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.230
We are going to eventually run this thing inside of Kubernetes.

04:25.230 --> 04:29.220
But for right now, let's change into this auth directory at our terminal and just make sure that we

04:29.220 --> 04:31.920
could run NPM start and have our applications start up.

04:33.060 --> 04:34.350
So back at my terminal.

04:35.090 --> 04:38.960
I'm inside my directory still, so I'll do an NPM start.

04:40.690 --> 04:41.380
And there we go.

04:41.410 --> 04:42.940
Looks like we are all set.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.850
Okay, so just a little bit of boilerplate to get started.

04:46.090 --> 04:50.050
Let's take a pause right here and discuss a couple of different things around this service in just a

04:50.050 --> 04:50.530
moment.
