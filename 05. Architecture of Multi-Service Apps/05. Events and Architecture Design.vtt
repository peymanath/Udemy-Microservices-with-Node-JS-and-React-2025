00:00.720 --> 00:03.540
One last video on the overall design of this application.

00:03.540 --> 00:06.690
So first I want to show you a list of the different events we're going to create.

00:06.960 --> 00:12.510
We're going to have events like user created, user updated, ticket created, ticket updated, everything

00:12.510 --> 00:13.710
you see on this list right here.

00:14.130 --> 00:17.550
Now, some of these events might not make a lot of sense right now, but over time, we're going to

00:17.550 --> 00:21.120
have a very deep discussion about the goal of each of these different events.

00:21.120 --> 00:25.050
You'll notice that right now they all kind of seem more or less kind of simple in nature, and the name

00:25.050 --> 00:27.240
of each of them is kind of self evident.

00:27.570 --> 00:33.150
So we're going to emit events like, say, order expired whenever a order goes over that 15 minute limit.

00:33.810 --> 00:37.590
I just want to give you this list of events right now, just to give you a picture of some of the different

00:37.590 --> 00:38.580
events we're going to create.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.970
But the absolute definition of each one is not super important right now.

00:43.280 --> 00:43.690
On that.

00:43.690 --> 00:45.410
Just one last quick diagram here.

00:45.430 --> 00:49.600
So this is going to be just a couple of notes on the overall design of each service.

00:50.020 --> 00:55.090
So we are going to have once again a kind of React client application that is going to be in charge

00:55.090 --> 00:57.010
of showing some content inside the browser.

00:57.520 --> 01:02.140
This time around, this React application is going to be built using next JS.

01:02.170 --> 01:05.260
If you are not familiar with next JS at all, don't sweat it.

01:05.290 --> 01:09.040
Next is a server side rendering react framework.

01:09.160 --> 01:13.600
There's a very, very good reason that we're going to use server side rendering in this application.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.870
We'll discuss why that is as soon as we start building that React application.

01:17.680 --> 01:22.360
We're then going to have our art tickets, orders payments and expiration services that are all going

01:22.360 --> 01:24.880
to be essentially simple node servers.

01:25.210 --> 01:30.070
Each one of them is going to be running express very similar to how we've been doing on that first project.

01:30.430 --> 01:34.270
This time around, each of these different services are going to have some persistent storage in the

01:34.270 --> 01:36.010
form of MongoDB.

01:36.910 --> 01:37.710
You know, absolutely.

01:37.710 --> 01:42.600
We could use a database besides MongoDB and some of these, but we're just going to stick with MongoDB

01:42.600 --> 01:47.460
all the way through because this is not really a course about teaching you the basics of database design

01:47.460 --> 01:48.520
or something like that.

01:48.540 --> 01:54.150
We could have some of these services using Mongo and maybe one over here using host Chris or what have

01:54.150 --> 01:54.540
you.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.660
But we're just going to stay consistent and use Mongo all the way through.

01:58.440 --> 02:02.790
Do you notice that the expiration service, on the other hand, is going to be making use of Redis?

02:02.820 --> 02:03.810
You have not used Redis.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.010
Again, don't sweat it.

02:05.010 --> 02:06.840
Super easy to learn and pick up.

02:07.410 --> 02:12.300
We're using Redis on expiration for a very, very particular reason and you'll see why as soon as we

02:12.300 --> 02:13.710
start building out that service.

02:14.560 --> 02:19.420
Each of these different services are going to be making use of a shared common library.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.960
So we're going to refer to this common library right here simply as common.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.390
Just about everything else inside this diagram.

02:25.390 --> 02:27.850
Is there a reference to a technology or something like that?

02:27.850 --> 02:32.320
In this case, Common is going to be an NPM module that you and I are going to build to share a bunch

02:32.320 --> 02:34.270
of code among these different services.

02:34.570 --> 02:39.490
So we're going to be putting a lot of time into this common library to figure out some of the different

02:39.490 --> 02:41.860
middle layers and events.

02:41.890 --> 02:46.540
Who knows what else we're going to need that are going to be commonly used between all these different

02:46.540 --> 02:47.320
services.

02:48.490 --> 02:53.500
And then finally for an event bus, rather than building our own this time around, we're going to be

02:53.500 --> 02:56.620
using something else called the Nats streaming server.

02:56.890 --> 03:02.830
Now the term Nats right here, if you've ever done some router setup like a home router, I'm not talking

03:02.830 --> 03:03.700
about an express router.

03:03.700 --> 03:06.730
I'm talking about an actual wi fi router or a networking router.

03:06.730 --> 03:11.770
You might have heard of something called NAT like network address translation that is totally different

03:11.770 --> 03:12.820
than that streaming server.

03:12.820 --> 03:17.590
So if you have heard of the term Nat, not the same as NAT streaming server.

03:17.590 --> 03:22.210
Essentially this is an event bus, somewhat similar nature to the one that we built just a little bit

03:22.210 --> 03:22.800
ago.

03:22.810 --> 03:26.890
Of course, it's very, very different in its implementation, tremendously different, but it's more

03:26.890 --> 03:29.290
or less going to do the same thing as the event.

03:29.290 --> 03:33.760
Plus, we put together a little bit ago it's going to receive some events from our services and then

03:33.760 --> 03:36.310
echo those events out to all of our other services.

03:36.310 --> 03:37.210
That's pretty much it.

03:38.130 --> 03:38.400
Okay.

03:38.400 --> 03:42.630
So again, I'm just showing this diagram to give you a picture of what we're going to have to do for

03:42.630 --> 03:43.630
this application.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.090
So one more pause right here.

03:45.090 --> 03:48.210
We're going to start writing some code and doing some setup in just a moment.
