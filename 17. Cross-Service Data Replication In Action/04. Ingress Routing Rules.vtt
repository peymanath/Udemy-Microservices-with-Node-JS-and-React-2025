00:01.080 --> 00:04.110
All right, last little piece of setup inside of our order service.

00:04.110 --> 00:07.980
So we're going to write out some routing rules inside of the ingress service config file.

00:08.400 --> 00:12.120
And we're going to eventually have a deep discussion about all the different routes that the order service

00:12.120 --> 00:13.110
is going to implement.

00:13.110 --> 00:18.180
But remember, inside of the Ingress Service file, we're essentially just saying if any request comes

00:18.180 --> 00:22.770
in for a route like API slash orders, send it over to the order service.

00:22.770 --> 00:26.760
That's the only thing we are really doing inside of that ingress engine x config file.

00:26.910 --> 00:28.230
So let's get to it right away.

00:29.190 --> 00:30.360
Inside of infra.

00:30.570 --> 00:32.340
I'll find Kate's inside of there.

00:32.340 --> 00:33.960
I'll find Ingress SRB.

00:35.970 --> 00:39.990
Inside this file, we're going to find those three different path rules that we've already set up.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.140
So once again, I will copy the tickets.

00:44.230 --> 00:44.980
BLOCK.

00:44.980 --> 00:46.780
I'm going to paste it right underneath.

00:47.470 --> 00:48.730
Fix the indentation.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.920
So I've now got the original tickets.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.100
I've got the new tickets right here on this new block.

00:56.100 --> 01:01.410
We're going to update tickets once and twice to orders.

01:02.010 --> 01:07.410
And once again, please make sure, please, please, please make sure that the client service is listed

01:07.410 --> 01:09.360
at the very bottom of this list.

01:09.630 --> 01:15.240
We want Ingress Engine X to try to match these first three paths right here before falling back to the

01:15.240 --> 01:16.200
client service.

01:18.100 --> 01:18.280
All right.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.990
Well, that's pretty much it for the ingress service.

01:19.990 --> 01:21.130
So we'll save this file.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.600
I'm going to close it.

01:22.600 --> 01:27.340
And finally, I should be able to go back over to my terminal and inside my scaffold terminal window.

01:27.340 --> 01:30.460
I should see something that says that the ingress service was configured.

01:30.640 --> 01:35.710
So in theory, we are now serving traffic up to that order service even though, well, the thing is

01:35.710 --> 01:40.930
not actually running because it is just crashing non-stop again because those broken import statements.

01:41.990 --> 01:44.030
Well, that is it for the initial setup.

01:44.030 --> 01:49.190
So now all we really have to do is figure out what the order service is truly supposed to do and work

01:49.190 --> 01:50.360
on its implementation.

01:50.630 --> 01:51.620
So pause right here.

01:51.620 --> 01:53.540
Let's figure that stuff out in just a moment.
