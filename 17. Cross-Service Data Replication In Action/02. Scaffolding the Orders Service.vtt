00:01.350 --> 00:03.930
We just got a reminder on the goal of the Order Service.

00:03.930 --> 00:06.120
So let's get started on putting this thing together.

00:06.150 --> 00:09.360
Here's what we're going to be doing inside of this video and the next one or two.

00:09.750 --> 00:13.830
And the order service is going to be extremely similar in nature to the ticketing service.

00:14.010 --> 00:18.390
So just about all the code, all the topics we have learned in the last couple of sections are going

00:18.390 --> 00:21.330
to be 100% applicable to the order service as well.

00:21.630 --> 00:26.190
This is actually really good news because it means we get to write the order service really quickly.

00:26.190 --> 00:31.170
It's going to come together in a fraction of the time as what we spend on the tickets service.

00:32.270 --> 00:33.230
So here's what we're going to do.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.530
We're going to duplicate a lot of code out of the ticket service.

00:36.560 --> 00:40.400
We're going to install some dependencies into the order service so we can eventually run some tests

00:40.400 --> 00:41.420
on our local machine.

00:41.990 --> 00:46.370
We'll build an image using Docker, create a Kubernetes deployment config file.

00:47.670 --> 00:52.500
Set up some file sync options inside of our scaffold YAML file to make sure all the changes we make

00:52.500 --> 00:54.870
inside of orders get synced into our running pod.

00:55.470 --> 00:59.130
And then finally we're going to set up some routing rules inside the ingress service as well.

00:59.620 --> 01:00.210
That's it.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.310
Let's get started right away.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.020
I'm going to flip back over to my editor and inside of my route ticketing directory, I'm going to make

01:07.020 --> 01:09.510
a new folder called Orders.

01:11.220 --> 01:16.500
I'm then going to open up my tickets directory and we're going to copy over a decent number of things

01:16.500 --> 01:18.360
inside of here, over two orders.

01:19.020 --> 01:20.910
So I'm going to multi select here.

01:20.940 --> 01:27.690
I'm going to get my config file package, JSON, package, lock, docker, file, docker, ignore.

01:28.050 --> 01:29.410
And we'll just start with those.

01:29.430 --> 01:32.940
So I'm going to copy all that and then paste it into orders.

01:34.990 --> 01:39.730
I'm then going to go into each of these files very quickly and just make sure that I change any references

01:39.730 --> 01:42.550
to the tickets service over to orders instead.

01:42.910 --> 01:44.620
So I'm going to start inside the Docker file.

01:45.010 --> 01:45.940
No issues here.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.310
I'm going to go into package JSON.

01:48.790 --> 01:50.850
It looks like we have a name inside of here of tickets.

01:50.860 --> 01:51.840
Doesn't really matter.

01:51.850 --> 01:54.430
Nonetheless, let's update it to say orders instead.

01:55.910 --> 01:58.630
I don't think there's anything else inside of here that's super relevant.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.320
So I'm going to save the file and close it.

02:00.530 --> 02:05.300
And then finally, the config file, definitely nothing super project specific inside of there.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.250
Next up inside of orders, I'm going to make a new folder called RC.

02:10.940 --> 02:13.640
We're going to copy over a couple of different things.

02:14.090 --> 02:22.010
So I'm going to first copy over Nat's wrapper index and app TS from the ticket's CRC directory.

02:23.110 --> 02:27.010
I'm going to copy those three and paste them into orders.

02:30.280 --> 02:34.420
If we now open up those three files inside of orders, we're definitely going to see a lot of errors

02:34.420 --> 02:35.610
throughout these different files.

02:35.620 --> 02:41.290
So for example, inside of orders, probably going to see some errors around this route stuff probably

02:41.290 --> 02:47.500
going to see a error or five inside the index file and inside of the Nat's wrapper as well.

02:48.130 --> 02:48.850
That's okay.

02:48.880 --> 02:52.240
As soon as we install dependencies, a lot of these errors are going to go away.

02:52.750 --> 02:55.720
And the ones that don't go away, we're going to fix up on our own.

02:58.770 --> 03:00.510
So that's all we're going to copy over for right now.

03:00.510 --> 03:05.010
We will eventually copy over a couple of other files from tickets, but that's good enough for right

03:05.010 --> 03:05.400
now.

03:06.930 --> 03:13.500
So onto step two, we're going to install dependencies into the order service on our local machine.

03:13.530 --> 03:17.640
The reason we're doing this is that we can eventually run some tests inside of here on our local machine

03:17.640 --> 03:21.660
without having to rely upon any odd or Docker stuff or anything like that.

03:22.020 --> 03:23.790
So I will go over to my terminal.

03:25.470 --> 03:28.920
I'm going to open up a new terminal window inside the ticketing project directory.

03:30.380 --> 03:33.890
Well then change into orders and do an NPM install.

03:35.670 --> 03:41.010
As we install defenses, we are going to have to redownload that MongoDB memory server binary, which

03:41.010 --> 03:42.630
usually takes a couple of minutes.

03:42.660 --> 03:42.870
Yep.

03:42.870 --> 03:43.860
There it is right there.

03:44.400 --> 03:48.060
Personally, I'm on a pretty slow internet connection, so it's going to take a little bit.

03:48.450 --> 03:53.820
So while that's running, let's go ahead and open up another terminal window and build an image out

03:53.820 --> 03:55.050
of this order service.

03:57.170 --> 04:01.040
So I'm going to open up another terminal window still inside of orders.

04:02.640 --> 04:09.120
And I'll run a Docker build dash to even greater orders.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.710
Naturally you will want to replace it even greater with your docker ID and then a dot.

04:19.830 --> 04:24.870
That's going to take a moment as well, because the image also has to download and install that MongoDB

04:24.870 --> 04:25.370
binary.

04:25.380 --> 04:26.270
Actually it does not.

04:26.280 --> 04:30.960
I forgot we we listed that inside of the dev dependencies, so that should go a little bit more quickly.

04:31.320 --> 04:36.330
Regardless, it is going to take just a moment for both the NPM installs and the Docker build right

04:36.330 --> 04:37.200
here to complete.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.660
So we'll take a pause right here and continue in just a minute.
