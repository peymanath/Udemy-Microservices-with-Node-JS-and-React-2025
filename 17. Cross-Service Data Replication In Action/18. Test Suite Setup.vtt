00:00.810 --> 00:04.950
As I mentioned at the end of the last video, we've got this request handler put together, but really

00:04.950 --> 00:06.470
no idea if it works or not.

00:06.480 --> 00:10.460
So in this video, we're going to start to set up our order service to run some number of tests.

00:10.470 --> 00:15.380
Then in the next video, we'll write out some tests around this new request handler to get started inside

00:15.400 --> 00:19.890
my CRC directory of the Order Service, I'm going to create a new folder called Test.

00:20.740 --> 00:24.210
I'll then go back over to my tickets service.

00:24.220 --> 00:25.090
Here it is right here.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.910
I'm going to find the test directory inside there.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.490
I'll find the setup file inside of that.

00:30.820 --> 00:35.920
I'm going to copy that setup file and take it over to the orders test directory that we just created

00:36.190 --> 00:37.180
and paste it in.

00:38.180 --> 00:39.890
All right, so here's the setup file.

00:40.430 --> 00:42.860
Immediately I'm seeing a couple of errors from it.

00:43.070 --> 00:46.400
We got some stuff around Gest and before all and whatnot.

00:46.700 --> 00:51.350
Once again, this is coming from B's code, just not understanding that we have already installed all

00:51.350 --> 00:52.300
this just stuff.

00:52.310 --> 00:55.400
So I'm going to do another quick reload of this window.

00:57.510 --> 00:59.610
And those errors should then go away.

00:59.790 --> 01:00.060
Yep.

01:00.060 --> 01:00.750
That's better.

01:01.480 --> 01:06.310
Just a reminder to reload the window you hit command shift p or on windows control shift p and you can

01:06.310 --> 01:09.010
search for reload window and run that command.

01:10.710 --> 01:14.460
We're going to do a quick scan over this file and make sure that we don't have any code inside of here

01:14.460 --> 01:17.880
related to the test service that needs to be replaced or updated.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.520
So I'm looking inside of here.

01:19.530 --> 01:22.220
We've got two import statements, so we ended up not using inside this file.

01:22.230 --> 01:23.610
I'm going to clean those up really quick.

01:24.470 --> 01:24.590
Okay.

01:24.650 --> 01:26.570
We still want to have the ability to sign in.

01:27.110 --> 01:29.540
We definitely still want to mock and that's rapper.

01:29.540 --> 01:33.140
So we're going to have to pull over that underscore underscore MOX Directory from the test service we

01:33.140 --> 01:33.950
had put together.

01:34.890 --> 01:36.830
We're still on all the MongoDB stuff.

01:36.890 --> 01:41.720
Still want to clear out our collections and still want to make sure that we have the ability to sign

01:41.720 --> 01:43.180
in and sign up and whatnot.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.750
So I'd say everything inside of here.

01:44.990 --> 01:46.190
Good to copy paste.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.180
Let's make sure we also pull over that underscore underscore box folder.

01:50.210 --> 01:55.190
So back inside of ticket service, I'll find the CRC directory that underscore underscore box.

01:55.190 --> 02:00.200
I'm going to copy that entire directory and then paste it into the order's source directory as well.

02:01.370 --> 02:01.500
Yeah.

02:01.610 --> 02:02.360
That looks good.

02:03.650 --> 02:07.230
Let's go over to our terminal really quick and just make sure that we can run our test suite.

02:07.250 --> 02:11.080
We don't have any tests inside of here just yet, so just is probably going to throw an error.

02:11.090 --> 02:14.900
But I just want to make sure that we don't get any other commands when we try to run our tests.

02:16.620 --> 02:21.840
So at my terminal, I'll change into this new order's service and then remember to run our test suite

02:21.870 --> 02:23.700
is and PM run test.

02:25.830 --> 02:26.220
All right.

02:26.220 --> 02:27.120
Well, let's say that's reasonable.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.980
No test found exiting with code zero.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.640
Well, it's a good start.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.870
So let's take a pause right here.

02:31.870 --> 02:35.800
We'll start to write out our tests around this new route handler in the next video.
