00:01.670 --> 00:05.630
Hopefully you have now signed up for a digital ocean account once you're at the screen right here.

00:05.660 --> 00:08.480
We're then going to create a new Kubernetes cluster.

00:08.780 --> 00:12.500
So as soon as we create this cluster, that is when you're going to start being billed for some amount

00:12.500 --> 00:13.100
of money.

00:13.340 --> 00:14.270
Just keep that in mind.

00:14.270 --> 00:19.340
If you ever walk away from this course, you do need to come back to this digital ocean dashboard and

00:19.340 --> 00:21.260
terminate the cluster and I'll show you how to do that.

00:21.260 --> 00:22.340
It is very easy.

00:23.030 --> 00:25.040
First, of course, we do have to create the cluster.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.210
So I'm going to find the green create button at the top right hand side and we're going to create a

00:29.210 --> 00:29.960
cluster.

00:33.730 --> 00:36.490
We're then going to be prompted with a series of different questions.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.840
First, Kubernetes version.

00:38.860 --> 00:40.870
You can use any version you see right here.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.610
Best to just leave it at the default.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.280
Next up is the data center region.

00:45.910 --> 00:48.620
Pricing between regions is identical with digital ocean.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.350
I'm pretty sure I could be wrong on that.

00:50.350 --> 00:53.280
At the end of the day, the region that you select doesn't make a big difference.

00:53.290 --> 00:56.660
Just make sure you select something that is physically close to you in the world.

00:56.680 --> 01:00.340
It's just going to reduce latency a little bit as you're trying to work with the cluster.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.430
For VPC network, we can leave that at the default.

01:04.910 --> 01:09.440
And then the only setting here that really makes a difference for us right now is the cluster capacity.

01:09.650 --> 01:14.480
So this is where we are going to add in some number of nodes or essentially virtual machines to run

01:14.480 --> 01:15.680
all of our different pods.

01:16.310 --> 01:20.090
By default, you should see something that says standard nodes right here.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.990
And have the $10 a month option selected.

01:24.010 --> 01:24.870
That's what we want.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.610
We want the $10 a month node selected right here.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.370
We're then going to make sure we have at least three nodes.

01:31.390 --> 01:35.590
You technically can get away with two, but you might have a hard time running our application with

01:35.590 --> 01:36.490
only two nodes.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.470
I would really recommend sticking it with three.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.770
So you can see that we're going to be paying about $30 a month.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.680
Now, you might recall the diagram was showing you just a moment ago.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.330
I said $40 a month over here.

01:47.360 --> 01:52.070
Well, we're going to also pay $10 for a load balancer as well, $10 a month.

01:52.100 --> 01:53.990
That's where the extra $10 comes from.

01:56.050 --> 02:00.200
Then going to go down to the very bottom and we can set a name for our cluster.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.950
You will be given a default name right here.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.160
I do recommend you update it to something that just makes sense to you.

02:05.170 --> 02:07.780
So for me, I'm going to call it simply ticketing.

02:09.590 --> 02:11.480
Well, then go ahead and create the cluster.

02:13.670 --> 02:14.900
And that's pretty much it.

02:15.500 --> 02:20.060
When you first create the cluster, it's going to take some number of minutes for it to first boot up.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.920
So you're going to see a little progress bar up here.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.410
And they're quoting me about 4 minutes or so.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.300
Who knows?

02:25.310 --> 02:28.940
So we're going to take a pause right here and just let this thing do its stuff.

02:29.120 --> 02:33.410
We'll come back the next video once everything is completed, setting up and we're going to make sure

02:33.410 --> 02:38.150
that we can deploy our application to it through a GitHub deployment pipeline.
