00:01.500 --> 00:04.770
It looks like everything inside of my deployment process went as expected.

00:05.070 --> 00:08.580
So I built the image, pushed it off to Docker Hub, restarted the deployment.

00:08.580 --> 00:11.160
And now if I go back over to my terminal, I should be able to do a.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.140
It'll get pods.

00:13.770 --> 00:16.470
I should be able to find the running pod right here.

00:17.270 --> 00:19.940
And I'm going to try to pull logs from that pod.

00:19.970 --> 00:24.560
When I pull logs, I should see a startup message that looks identical to the one that we had just authored

00:24.560 --> 00:29.750
back inside of its index file, though, starting up with about eight dots or so.

00:30.790 --> 00:36.700
So to pull logs from that pod right there, I'm going to do a little logs and then I'll paste in the

00:36.700 --> 00:37.960
name of that pod.

00:40.390 --> 00:41.160
And there we go.

00:41.170 --> 00:44.560
So we've got starting up with the appropriate number of dots, which means that we have deployed the

00:44.560 --> 00:46.510
latest version of our service.

00:47.020 --> 00:48.670
Well, this looks pretty fantastic.

00:49.370 --> 00:54.290
Now, the last thing we really have to do here, besides a little bit of networking for ingress in Gen

00:54.290 --> 01:00.050
X, you have to go around to all of our other services and create a very similar deployment file for

01:00.050 --> 01:01.010
them as well.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.390
We'll make this change directly on GitHub, so we'll just use the built in GitHub editor.

01:05.420 --> 01:11.030
We're essentially going to duplicate that deployment off file that we get created just a moment ago.

01:11.540 --> 01:13.970
So back on GitHub, I'm going to go to my code tab.

01:15.930 --> 01:18.390
I'm going to find GitHub slash workflows.

01:19.690 --> 01:22.430
I'm going to open up, deploy, offer HTML.

01:24.020 --> 01:29.840
And then we're going to copy everything inside of here into about five other files in total, I think.

01:30.720 --> 01:34.710
So we have to create one for client tickets, payment, all that stuff.

01:34.740 --> 01:35.200
And you know what?

01:35.220 --> 01:38.790
Now that I mentioned that using the built in GitHub editor is probably going to be a little bit of a

01:38.790 --> 01:39.260
pain.

01:39.270 --> 01:44.640
So how about instead we just copy this and create some YAML files inside of our workflows directory

01:44.640 --> 01:47.880
inside of our local editor rather than using the GitHub one.

01:48.330 --> 01:53.040
That just means we're going to have to do another push directly to our master branch, which is okay

01:53.040 --> 01:54.120
in this case.

01:55.060 --> 01:57.250
All right, so I'm going to copy everything we see inside of here.

01:57.790 --> 01:59.320
I'll then go backward to my terminal.

01:59.350 --> 02:01.300
I'm going to make sure I check out Master.

02:01.510 --> 02:05.140
And just to be careful, I'm going to pull down all the changes once again.

02:05.740 --> 02:08.260
Because I keep trying to push after forgetting to pull.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.480
Then back inside of our Ed.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.290
We can find that dot github workflows directory.

02:17.190 --> 02:22.530
So inside of here, we're going to create a collection of different deploy files or client orders,

02:22.530 --> 02:24.650
tickets, payments and exploration.

02:24.660 --> 02:30.000
So inside of workflows, I'll make a new file of deploy client HTML.

02:31.290 --> 02:34.180
I'll make another one of deploy orders.

02:34.910 --> 02:35.550
Gamble.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.650
Deploy tickets.

02:41.180 --> 02:42.140
Deploy.

02:42.950 --> 02:43.760
Payments.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.010
And deploy expiration.

02:52.630 --> 02:52.900
All right.

02:52.900 --> 02:53.860
So a couple of different files here.

02:53.860 --> 02:58.120
We're going to have to go through each one and just paste in all that stuff that we just copied and

02:58.120 --> 03:01.030
make a couple of changes to just a couple of different properties inside there.

03:01.030 --> 03:05.710
We're pretty much just fixing up the name because we've got a lot of references to off inside the script

03:05.710 --> 03:09.550
and we just need to update those references to whatever we're actually trying to reference.

03:11.140 --> 03:11.440
All right.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.100
So back inside, let's start with how about our client deployment file?

03:15.550 --> 03:17.230
So deploy client yaml.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.110
I'm going to paste all that stuff that we just copied inside of here.

03:22.770 --> 03:26.940
We're then going to go through and replace every reference to auth with client.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.890
So client.

03:29.930 --> 03:30.710
Client.

03:32.290 --> 03:33.040
Client.

03:33.040 --> 03:33.970
That's three.

03:35.030 --> 03:36.140
Here is for.

03:37.490 --> 03:38.600
Years five.

03:39.910 --> 03:41.530
And here is six.

03:43.800 --> 03:48.390
So if I do a find inside of here and look for off, I should get no results.

03:50.490 --> 03:52.380
I'm going to save that file and close it.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.670
We'll move on to how about expiration next?

03:56.970 --> 04:01.230
So inside of the deploy expiration file, I'm going to do another paste and we're going to make sure

04:01.230 --> 04:05.190
that we change six instances of off over to expiration.

04:05.730 --> 04:07.980
So in this case, I'm going to do a multi select.

04:08.480 --> 04:14.220
There's one, two, three, four, five and six.

04:14.460 --> 04:16.590
I'm going to change all six to expiration.

04:18.580 --> 04:22.090
Once again, I should be able to do a find inside of here for off and find nothing.

04:24.110 --> 04:24.830
What's next?

04:24.860 --> 04:26.180
We got our orders.

04:26.180 --> 04:27.710
File the deploy orders.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.150
I'll do a paste.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.650
One, two, three, four, five and six.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.070
Change them all over to orders.

04:35.790 --> 04:37.400
Again do a search for auth.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.910
Make sure I get zero results.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.170
Onto your payments.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.490
They'll do a paste.

04:46.260 --> 04:53.110
One, two, three, four, five and six over two payments as usual, do a search for auth.

04:53.130 --> 04:54.600
Make sure I got zero results.

04:55.850 --> 04:56.780
Save that and close it.

04:56.780 --> 05:01.970
And we are on to our last one, the deploy tickets YAML file, so I'll do another paste.

05:03.770 --> 05:07.700
One, two, three, four, five and six.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.880
Change them two tickets, and that should be it.

05:11.210 --> 05:12.280
One more quick check here.

05:12.290 --> 05:14.630
Just make sure we don't have the word off inside this file.

05:15.540 --> 05:16.480
All right, so that should be it.

05:16.500 --> 05:20.730
Now, at this point, this is another location where I can guarantee you a lot of people are going to

05:20.730 --> 05:25.290
forget to change the word off inside of one of these files in just about guarantee it.

05:25.560 --> 05:31.500
So it really would be worth your time to double check the deploy files that we just created, all five

05:31.500 --> 05:35.880
of them, and just double check, make sure you do not have the word off inside of any of them.

05:36.240 --> 05:40.200
An easier way to do this would be to do a find on the workflows directory.

05:41.430 --> 05:47.130
So inside of the workflows folder I can do a search for off and I should only find results inside of

05:47.130 --> 05:49.530
deploy off and tests off.

05:53.660 --> 05:53.930
All right.

05:53.930 --> 05:54.800
So it looks good.

05:55.370 --> 05:58.780
Now, once again, we're going to commit these changes directly to master and push them up.

05:58.790 --> 06:03.590
We can then try to make a change to each of these different services, create a PR for all them, merge

06:03.590 --> 06:07.550
the PR and make sure that all of these changes actually get deployed into our cluster.

06:09.950 --> 06:13.790
So back at my terminal I'll do a get status while on the master branch.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.400
I should see the five deploy files we just created.

06:17.220 --> 06:18.570
I'll add all five them.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.930
And commit them.

06:27.450 --> 06:28.740
And then push off.

06:30.530 --> 06:35.240
Now again, because we are pushing directly to master our workflows are going to immediately run for

06:35.240 --> 06:37.070
all five of those different files.

06:37.430 --> 06:41.570
So we should see new deployments or jobs running for all five.

06:41.870 --> 06:45.110
But in this case, remember, the one thing to keep in mind as well is that we do have a filter in there

06:45.110 --> 06:50.150
to make sure that we only try to do a deployment or run those workflows if something changed inside

06:50.150 --> 06:51.410
the respective services.

06:51.650 --> 06:55.340
So actually, on second thought, we probably won't see any deployments running at all at this point.

06:55.340 --> 07:00.320
We actually do have to make a change to all five services and commit them, make the pull request,

07:00.320 --> 07:04.130
merge the pull request to actually trigger a change inside those directories.

07:04.130 --> 07:06.710
And that finally is going to run our actual workflows.

07:07.340 --> 07:11.420
So let's take a pause right here and take a shot at that in the next video.
