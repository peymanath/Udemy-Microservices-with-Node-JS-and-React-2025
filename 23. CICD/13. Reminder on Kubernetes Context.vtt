00:01.080 --> 00:03.720
Well, it looks like my cluster is now all up and ready.

00:03.810 --> 00:08.610
We're now going to try to connect to that cluster from our local machine using ETL.

00:08.850 --> 00:13.080
We're only doing this so that we can later debug our cluster, get logs and stuff like that.

00:13.110 --> 00:16.300
We are generally not going to manually deploy anything to our cluster.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.730
Again, we're only connecting to it to debug it and understand what is going on inside.

00:21.860 --> 00:25.670
Remember that in order to connect two different clusters, we're going to use Cube Kettle.

00:25.850 --> 00:31.820
We discussed this very briefly much earlier on inside the course as a very quick reminder up CTL decides

00:31.820 --> 00:35.570
on how to connect to some given cluster by using something called context.

00:35.960 --> 00:41.780
The context refers to some configuration settings that tells CTL how to connect to, say, a local cluster

00:41.780 --> 00:46.970
that you're running on your machine, maybe one on Google Cloud or maybe the one that we just created

00:46.970 --> 00:48.200
on Digital Ocean.

00:49.030 --> 00:54.340
So we're going to have to create a second context to tell you how to connect to that cluster that we

00:54.340 --> 00:55.270
just created.

00:56.010 --> 01:00.570
To create the second context, we're going to use the command line tool for interacting with digital

01:00.570 --> 01:01.650
ocean directly.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.810
We can get some instructions on how to install this digital ocean command line tool.

01:07.230 --> 01:11.050
If we go back over to our Digital Ocean page and click on right here.

01:11.070 --> 01:13.470
Number two, install management tools.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.360
You'll then see a link right here to dock.

01:17.430 --> 01:20.750
Tell that is the command line tool that we want to install.

01:21.170 --> 01:24.350
If you do not see this little pop up window right here, no problem.

01:24.350 --> 01:27.110
Just open up a new browser tab and go to GitHub.

01:27.740 --> 01:29.570
Digital Ocean Deal.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.220
That's how I pronounce it.

01:31.230 --> 01:33.140
I don't know if that's actually how you're supposed to pronounce it.

01:33.150 --> 01:34.920
Dostal dactyl.

01:35.070 --> 01:35.820
Good enough.

01:36.700 --> 01:39.160
So once a year we can find some installation directions.

01:40.720 --> 01:44.200
As usual, if you are on Mac OS, life is really easy.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.460
You can just use homebrew.

01:45.910 --> 01:50.920
Otherwise, if you are on Linux or Windows, you can scroll down a little bit more.

01:50.950 --> 01:52.920
Take a look at how to just download the binary.

01:52.930 --> 01:57.100
If you're on Linux, if you're on Windows, you're probably going to want to download the installer

01:57.100 --> 01:57.730
instead.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.930
So go ahead and do the installation.

02:02.320 --> 02:08.800
Once the installation is complete, you should be able to open up your terminal, run at ductile and

02:08.800 --> 02:10.390
see some help like this appear.

02:11.450 --> 02:16.460
Once Tactile is installed, we have to then initialize it or essentially authenticate yourself with

02:16.460 --> 02:17.900
your digital ocean account.

02:18.290 --> 02:21.620
To do so, we're going to run the command ductile off init.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.660
But first we have to do one other thing.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.020
I kind of jumped ahead right there.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.540
Let's not run that command just yet.

02:27.080 --> 02:31.220
So to actually authenticate ourselves, we do have to go back over to the Digital Ocean Dashboard.

02:31.880 --> 02:35.390
Over here, we're going to find on the bottom left hand side API.

02:36.780 --> 02:39.020
But then going to generate a new token.

02:39.030 --> 02:44.640
So this is an access token that gives you full access programmatically over your digital ocean account.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.630
You can enter in a name right here.

02:47.650 --> 02:51.790
I'm going to put in ductile too, because I've already got one called ductile.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.070
And I'll be presented with that token right there.

02:56.370 --> 02:59.820
Now, just, you know, by the time you watch this video, I will have already deleted this token,

02:59.820 --> 03:01.530
so don't bother trying to use this one.

03:02.370 --> 03:03.840
So you will copy that token.

03:04.540 --> 03:07.030
You'll then run that dactyl off in it.

03:07.180 --> 03:10.300
Once you run that, you'll be prompted to paste in the token.

03:10.300 --> 03:13.990
So paste it in hit enter and then you should be authenticated.

03:15.070 --> 03:19.600
So once we've got Dr. Elle up and running, we can then use it to install a context to connect to our

03:19.600 --> 03:22.430
cluster into our local copy of ETL.

03:22.750 --> 03:26.590
But at this point, we've already done a couple of things, and these next series of commands we're

03:26.590 --> 03:28.890
going to run are going to be just a little bit confusing.

03:28.900 --> 03:32.260
So let's pause right here and then make use of ductile in just a moment.
