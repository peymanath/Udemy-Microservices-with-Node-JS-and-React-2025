WEBVTT

00:01.860 --> 00:02.160
All right.

00:02.160 --> 00:04.360
Time to test out the final test here.

00:04.380 --> 00:09.180
We're going to make sure that we can make a change to all five of the services besides off.

00:09.420 --> 00:14.820
And if we commit those changes, make a PR merge in the PR, we should see all five of these additional

00:14.820 --> 00:17.010
services be updated inside of our cluster.

00:17.400 --> 00:22.770
So we're going to essentially go through client expiration orders, payments and tickets, and we're

00:22.770 --> 00:25.470
going to make one small, arbitrary change to each of them.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.510
Let's start off first with client.

00:27.870 --> 00:29.110
How about inside of client?

00:29.130 --> 00:32.610
Let's change all about on pages.

00:32.760 --> 00:33.990
Index JS.

00:36.890 --> 00:38.720
How about on the h one right here?

00:39.140 --> 00:41.000
Let's just change that to an h two.

00:42.220 --> 00:43.990
So just a small, arbitrary change.

00:45.640 --> 00:45.880
Yes.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.210
That's one change down.

00:47.230 --> 00:49.120
Next, I'm going to go to expiration.

00:49.390 --> 00:53.770
Instead of expiration, I'm going to open up the index file very similar to the others.

00:53.770 --> 00:55.660
Let's add in a little console.log.

00:57.430 --> 00:59.320
At the very top of the start function.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.900
There's a change to our expiration service.

01:05.850 --> 01:12.390
Then inside of orders inside the index file allowed in another couple of dots to the starting message

01:12.390 --> 01:13.740
that we had already added in.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.010
Inside of payments.

01:19.970 --> 01:23.390
Let's open the indexed file very similar to the others.

01:23.420 --> 01:25.040
Let in a little starting.

01:25.910 --> 01:27.170
Console.log at the top.

01:31.050 --> 01:35.410
And then finally inside of tickets, open up our indexed file.

01:35.430 --> 01:35.790
Yep.

01:35.790 --> 01:36.300
You guessed it.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.080
Same thing.

01:37.770 --> 01:39.120
A little starting.

01:40.020 --> 01:40.860
Console.log.

01:42.690 --> 01:42.990
Okay.

01:42.990 --> 01:46.420
So we now have changes made to five different services.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.040
So if we now commit these, create the pull request, merge the pull request gets.

01:50.070 --> 01:54.450
GitHub should detect that something inside of each of these folders has changed and it should run the

01:54.450 --> 01:56.100
respective deployment files.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.350
So let's go back over to our terminal.

01:58.860 --> 02:01.110
We're going to change over to our def branch.

02:03.190 --> 02:04.720
We'll see all five those changes.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.640
Make sure you've got five changes right here.

02:08.550 --> 02:11.400
We will add all those, commit them.

02:14.730 --> 02:16.680
And then push to our debt branch once again.

02:24.410 --> 02:25.820
Then back over on GitHub.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.780
Almost the last time we have to do this.

02:28.780 --> 02:29.320
Don't worry.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.320
I know creating these pull requests gets kind of tiresome really quickly.

02:32.410 --> 02:35.470
We're going to create a new pull request for the Def branch once again.

02:38.420 --> 02:43.250
They'll select Dev and I'm going to try to merge Dev into master and I should see the commits that I

02:43.250 --> 02:45.590
just made or really the one commit.

02:46.190 --> 02:51.020
So I should have changes to client expiration orders, payments and tickets.

02:52.490 --> 02:53.960
We're going to create this polar request.

02:57.700 --> 02:58.600
I'll create it.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.230
Now I can allow all these tests to run.

03:04.500 --> 03:05.850
So I'm just going to hold for a second.

03:05.850 --> 03:07.560
Let these tests run and finish up.

03:10.830 --> 03:14.040
My tests are now complete, so I'm going to merge the polar request.

03:18.230 --> 03:18.620
All right.

03:18.620 --> 03:22.040
So now, once again, we can go back up to the top, take a look at actions.

03:23.240 --> 03:28.460
Now we should be able to take a look at our workflows for deploy orders, payments, tickets, expiration

03:28.460 --> 03:31.430
and client and see that all them have a running job.

03:31.460 --> 03:33.830
Or we can just look at this main display right here as well.

03:34.190 --> 03:39.440
So it looks like I'm running a job from client exploration tickets, payments and orders.

03:40.010 --> 03:42.290
Now we can wait for 30 seconds or so.

03:42.290 --> 03:45.190
Once again, we should see all these jobs go green.

03:45.200 --> 03:49.490
If any of them fail, that means that there is definitely some configuration issue and you'll want to

03:49.490 --> 03:50.960
take a look at the message.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.250
You can click on the job.

03:52.250 --> 03:57.200
It will give you some information on why the job failed, and you'll use that as the source to try to

03:57.200 --> 03:59.240
debug this thing and figure out what is going on.

03:59.870 --> 04:04.670
Now, if you tried to debug a failing job and you just don't have any idea what's going on and you need

04:04.670 --> 04:09.020
help, I'd be happy to help you, but you got to link me to your repository.

04:09.020 --> 04:10.280
I've got to see your code.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.600
Make sure that your repository is public and provide me a link.

04:14.600 --> 04:18.770
You can email it to me or post something in the queue and I'll take a look at these failing jobs and

04:18.770 --> 04:20.960
hopefully be able to help you figure out what is going on.

04:24.830 --> 04:28.730
Eventually all these jobs should go green, which means that hopefully we have successfully built the

04:28.730 --> 04:31.640
images and deployed them off to our Kubernetes cluster.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.660
So I'm then going to go back over to my terminal.

04:33.680 --> 04:37.970
We're going to do another git pods and just make sure that we've got some latest versions of all these

04:37.970 --> 04:38.750
images running.

04:41.470 --> 04:42.040
All right.

04:42.310 --> 04:44.650
It looks like I have an air or two right here.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.650
Chances are that pod is still in the process of being deployed.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.870
It looks like everything else is successfully running.

04:50.440 --> 04:55.630
Now, if you have any pods that are persistently airing out, so do give it a minute or two to kind

04:55.630 --> 04:57.580
of resolve and launch all these new pods.

04:57.580 --> 05:01.750
But if after a couple of minutes it looks like everything is still crashing, I would encourage you

05:01.750 --> 05:03.250
to take the name of the pod.

05:03.310 --> 05:09.760
Let's say the expiration service one is crashing and do a little describe pod and then put in the name

05:09.760 --> 05:12.080
of the pod when you run that command.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.370
It'll then give you hopefully some reasons on why it is crashing.

05:15.490 --> 05:17.440
Specifically in the event section down here.

05:17.890 --> 05:24.250
The other thing you can do is pull logs off of a crashing pod so you can do a little logs and then put

05:24.250 --> 05:25.810
the name of the pod in.

05:27.540 --> 05:28.740
So something like.

05:30.860 --> 05:31.790
Take the name.

05:34.040 --> 05:34.850
But in the name.

05:34.850 --> 05:39.170
And then you will hopefully see some information right here to help you understand exactly what is crashing.

05:40.060 --> 05:40.360
All right.

05:40.360 --> 05:44.290
So at this point, hopefully, again, after a couple of minutes, you eventually see all these different

05:44.290 --> 05:45.730
prods running successfully.

05:45.790 --> 05:48.450
That means that our application is up and running.

05:48.460 --> 05:49.180
Yay!

05:49.210 --> 05:50.530
That's exactly what we want.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.170
Now, we cannot test this out just yet.

05:53.170 --> 06:00.130
As a reminder, we still do need to get a domain name and register it or assign it to our Ingress Engine

06:00.130 --> 06:00.940
X service.

06:00.940 --> 06:05.200
So we still have a little bit of setup to go through here, but it looks like our cluster is more or

06:05.200 --> 06:06.130
less ready to go.
