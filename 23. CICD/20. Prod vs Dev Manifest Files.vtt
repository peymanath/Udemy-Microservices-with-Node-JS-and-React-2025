00:00.950 --> 00:04.250
In the last video, we discussed how this singular property right here really needs to be different

00:04.250 --> 00:07.550
depending upon whether we are on a development or production cluster.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.010
There are a couple of different ways of handling this.

00:10.040 --> 00:12.410
I'm going to show you a very simple, straightforward way.

00:13.220 --> 00:13.910
To solve this.

00:13.910 --> 00:17.450
We're going to create a couple of additional directories inside of our infra folder.

00:17.810 --> 00:23.090
I'm going to create another folder inside of infra called a dash prod.

00:24.310 --> 00:28.450
And then another one called AIDS Dev.

00:29.270 --> 00:34.160
The idea here is that we are going to have some number of manifests or YAML files split between all

00:34.160 --> 00:35.210
three directories.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.940
Inside of our directory, we're going to have a series of manifest files that can be applied to any

00:40.940 --> 00:42.250
cluster that we connect to.

00:42.260 --> 00:44.960
So either a production or deployment cluster.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.870
Inside of the AIDS dev directory.

00:47.870 --> 00:51.740
As you would guess, we're going to play some config files inside of here that are only supposed to

00:51.740 --> 00:53.960
be applied to a development cluster.

00:54.230 --> 00:58.970
And then inside of kids prod are going to be manifests that are supposed to be applied to a production

00:58.970 --> 00:59.630
cluster.

01:00.550 --> 01:07.630
So now I'm going to take my ingress service file and I'm going to move it into the K dev folder.

01:09.470 --> 01:14.420
Because this file, as it stands right now, should be only applied to a development cluster.

01:14.420 --> 01:19.340
I do not want to use this on my production cluster because that will expose or make use of a host of

01:19.340 --> 01:20.240
ticketing def.

01:21.390 --> 01:27.650
Then inside of Kate's prod, I'm going to make a new file also called Ingress SVG, html.

01:28.520 --> 01:33.710
I'm going to copy everything from the existing Ingress service file and paste it over here.

01:34.220 --> 01:39.810
And now in theory, we will change this hostname right here to whatever our final domain name is.

01:39.830 --> 01:43.940
We have not yet purchased a domain name for our application, so we don't have anything to change that

01:43.940 --> 01:44.810
to just yet.

01:44.810 --> 01:49.610
But as soon as we do purchase a domain name for our app, we will come back to the prod file right here

01:49.610 --> 01:51.260
and update that host property.

01:54.690 --> 01:55.180
That's it.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.120
We now have these three different directories.

01:57.120 --> 02:02.430
And again, KATES is going to hold everything that is related to any given cluster, be it development

02:02.430 --> 02:03.330
or production.

02:03.330 --> 02:06.000
Dev is for just development and prod is for prod.

02:06.630 --> 02:10.800
Now, by just moving these folders around and moving these files around, well, we do have to fix up

02:10.800 --> 02:14.310
a couple of other things that are making use of these config files.

02:14.940 --> 02:18.660
So first off, we do have to make sure that we open up our scaffold YAML file.

02:20.260 --> 02:24.550
So whenever we run Scaffold, we're going to tell it that in addition to some config files we've placed

02:24.550 --> 02:30.400
inside that directory, we also want it to use some config files that are going to be inside of the

02:31.150 --> 02:34.540
dev directory so I can add in that line right there.

02:36.520 --> 02:40.600
We're also going to go back over to our GitHub repository.

02:41.500 --> 02:45.430
We're going to find the deploy manifest config file that we just put together.

02:45.910 --> 02:50.560
And we were going to adjust that command right there and make sure that in addition to applying everything

02:50.560 --> 02:55.450
from the folder, we also apply everything from the prod folder as well.

02:56.020 --> 02:57.490
So I'm going to edit this file.

02:59.050 --> 03:01.480
And I'll put in a little and step right here.

03:03.190 --> 03:08.090
It'll apply f infra slash 8/8 dashboard.

03:08.620 --> 03:13.840
I think that you might possibly be able to put in multiple directories to a dash f reference.

03:13.880 --> 03:19.000
I'm actually not 100% sure now that I'd say it out loud, so that would actually be a pretty good place

03:19.000 --> 03:20.800
to look at the documentation for that.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.450
You might be able to simplify this to just something that looks like that right there.

03:24.460 --> 03:27.430
But again, you might look at the documentation on your own.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.640
They all commit at this file again.

03:32.830 --> 03:33.070
Okay.

03:33.070 --> 03:34.720
So now we should be good to go.

03:34.780 --> 03:39.520
Once we buy a domain name, we're going to come back to that prod ingress service file, update the

03:39.520 --> 03:41.620
host and that should pretty much be it.

03:42.440 --> 03:46.100
Well, I think that we're just about ready for an actual test run here.

03:46.130 --> 03:50.630
Now, before we do a test run, there is a little bit more setup we have to do specifically around our

03:50.630 --> 03:51.260
cluster.

03:51.290 --> 03:57.080
You might recall that our cluster expects there to be one or two secrets to find, such as the JSON

03:57.080 --> 03:58.700
web token key secret.

03:59.180 --> 04:04.280
So we define that a very long time ago and we made use of it inside of our deployment.

04:04.730 --> 04:05.750
So here it is right here.

04:05.870 --> 04:10.240
Right now, our digital ocean cluster does not have a secret called JWT.

04:10.630 --> 04:14.360
And I think there might be one other secret somewhere inside of here as well that we have to mainly

04:14.360 --> 04:15.890
create inside of our cluster as well.

04:16.280 --> 04:21.350
So once we create those two secrets, one or two secrets will then be able to test out this entire flow

04:21.350 --> 04:23.180
and then start to finish things up.
