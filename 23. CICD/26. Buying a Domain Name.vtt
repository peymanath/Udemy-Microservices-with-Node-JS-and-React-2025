00:00.760 --> 00:05.660
The last big thing we have to do is get a domain name and pointed at our Kubernetes application running

00:05.660 --> 00:06.920
on Digital Ocean.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.740
Let's go back over to our Digital Ocean Dashboard really quick.

00:09.740 --> 00:13.060
I want to show you something interesting over on Digital Ocean.

00:13.070 --> 00:16.130
On the left hand side, I'm going to find the networking tab right here.

00:17.660 --> 00:22.970
Then I'm going to click on load balancers and you might notice that you have a load balancer right here.

00:23.450 --> 00:28.970
This load balancer was created automatically by Ingress and Gen X when we created it inside of our cluster.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.530
This load balancer.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.770
And by the way, if you see some things right here saying down, that's totally fine.

00:33.770 --> 00:36.650
Digital ocean is buggy sometimes, particularly the dashboard.

00:36.890 --> 00:40.760
So this load balancer is directing traffic into your cluster.

00:41.640 --> 00:46.050
If we want to somehow get access to our cluster from a normal web browser, here's what we have to do.

00:46.870 --> 00:52.000
Right now on Digital Ocean, we've got our cluster as three nodes and we also have a load balancer.

00:52.480 --> 00:57.010
The load balancer has an external IP assigned to it automatically by digital ocean.

00:57.280 --> 01:01.480
You can find that external IP listed right here up at the top.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.340
As a matter of fact, if you copy that IP right now and try to visit it inside your browser, you'll

01:06.340 --> 01:07.780
get a 404 not found.

01:08.660 --> 01:12.620
And that is an error, of course, but you'll notice that the air is coming from engine x.

01:12.980 --> 01:19.280
So right now you are making request to your ingress engine X load balancer, but unfortunately you are

01:19.280 --> 01:21.500
using no hostname whatsoever.

01:21.500 --> 01:25.460
And so none of the routing rules we had put together inside of our service file are being applied to

01:25.460 --> 01:26.390
your request.

01:27.480 --> 01:33.150
So in order to get this working, we have to buy a domain name and point it at that load balancer or

01:33.150 --> 01:35.280
specifically really the IP address.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.050
That's what we really need to do next.

01:37.050 --> 01:42.030
We need to purchase a domain name and then point it at the load balancer that was created for us automatically.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.870
The purchase the domain name I'm going to use name cheap.

01:49.170 --> 01:53.040
Now you can use absolutely any domain name provider you want to use.

01:53.060 --> 01:56.080
So Name Cheap is one that I use to manage a couple of different domain names.

01:56.090 --> 01:57.400
Again, it's totally up to you.

01:57.410 --> 01:59.690
Use any domain name provider you wish.

02:00.630 --> 02:02.580
We don't really need any particular domain name.

02:02.580 --> 02:06.040
We just need really the cheapest one around so we can test everything out.

02:06.060 --> 02:10.650
So me personally, I'm going to try to buy a domain name of something like I don't know.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.990
Ticketing dash app dash fraud.

02:15.410 --> 02:20.870
Remember, the longer the domain name is in general, the more characters it has generally, the cheaper

02:20.870 --> 02:21.500
it is.

02:22.160 --> 02:27.710
So if I tried to buy a domain name like that, I can look around a little bit and it looks like I can

02:27.710 --> 02:32.180
get ticketing at product XYZ or just $1 a year.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.350
Well, that's pretty cheap.

02:34.510 --> 02:38.330
You could definitely look around and say, here's one at $1.29.

02:38.350 --> 02:40.360
Definitely some pretty cheap options out there.

02:40.630 --> 02:42.460
Here's one at 280.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.670
So go ahead and pick up any old domain name.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.560
I'm going to buy this one in particular.

02:50.070 --> 02:53.190
I'll then view that item and I'm going to check out.

02:55.910 --> 02:59.690
So at this point, I'm going to enter in my credit card information and purchase this domain name.

02:59.900 --> 03:03.250
So go ahead and purchase a domain of your own and I'll see you in the next video.

03:03.260 --> 03:07.820
Once you have purchased the domain, then we're going to set up that domain and point it at our running

03:07.820 --> 03:09.920
load balancer over on Digital Ocean.
