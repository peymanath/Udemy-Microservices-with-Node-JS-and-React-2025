00:01.500 --> 00:03.280
All right, so let's test out this workflow.

00:03.300 --> 00:05.640
So we're going to begin on this first step right here.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.850
We're going to make changes to some service inside of our project.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.340
In this case, the changes don't really matter all that much.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.440
I just want to have some change that we can commit.

00:13.860 --> 00:19.320
But how about we try out going into our service, finding the index file inside there?

00:20.720 --> 00:23.820
And how about right at the very start of our start function?

00:23.840 --> 00:26.810
Let's just add in a little console log of starting up.

00:28.180 --> 00:28.600
That's it.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.190
That's the change that we want to commit.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.780
So I'm going to save this file and close it out.

00:34.770 --> 00:35.790
That's step one.

00:35.790 --> 00:40.440
And I can move on to step two where we are going to commit that code to a new branch.

00:40.950 --> 00:42.300
The back over at my terminal.

00:43.860 --> 00:47.820
I'm going to check out a new branch with git check out.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.770
Ashby and I'll give this branch a very simple name of Dev Short for development.

00:55.260 --> 00:58.820
Once I've created that new branch, I'll check my status.

00:59.130 --> 01:00.990
There's the file that we just changed.

01:01.020 --> 01:07.800
We're going to add that and commit it with the message of added startup message.

01:10.460 --> 01:10.570
Yeah.

01:10.610 --> 01:13.670
So we just changed or committed those changes to a new branch.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.830
It was a branch that was not the master branch.

01:15.830 --> 01:17.080
That's the very critical part here.

01:17.090 --> 01:19.490
We're not going to commit directly to the master branch.

01:20.310 --> 01:22.440
Now we're going to push that branch up to GitHub.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.370
So to do so, we'll do a git push origin.

01:31.650 --> 01:32.490
It looks good.

01:32.940 --> 01:35.610
It looks like we created a new branch.

01:36.580 --> 01:37.390
On GitHub.

01:38.090 --> 01:40.460
So GitHub has now received that updated branch.

01:41.090 --> 01:43.110
We're now going to log on to GitHub.

01:43.130 --> 01:47.540
We're going to take a look at a repository and we're going to create a pull request manually to merge

01:47.540 --> 01:49.370
that branch into our master.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.410
So back at my GitHub repo.

01:52.090 --> 01:54.100
I'm going to go to the request tab.

01:55.560 --> 02:00.690
I can either click on this compare and pull request button right here for Dev or I can create the pull

02:00.690 --> 02:01.740
request manually.

02:01.890 --> 02:05.670
I'm going to show how to create it manually because we don't always see this yellow box appear right

02:05.670 --> 02:06.180
here.

02:06.810 --> 02:08.820
So I can either click on the first screen one.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.830
In this case, I'm going to go with new pull request.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.050
And then going to be prompted with what I am taking code from or which branch I'm going from, which

02:17.050 --> 02:18.550
branch I'm merging it to.

02:19.090 --> 02:24.100
So I want to go from my dev branch and merge that into master.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.610
So I should see in these dropdowns master and then dev.

02:29.370 --> 02:31.290
I'll then click on Create Pull Request.

02:32.740 --> 02:37.180
We get prompted to add in a message, so a title for the request itself and then some description right

02:37.180 --> 02:38.950
here of the changes that we are making.

02:39.280 --> 02:43.990
So in theory, we would want to put in some description of what just happened or why I'm trying to merge

02:43.990 --> 02:45.100
this code into master.

02:45.610 --> 02:51.130
So I might put in a description here that says something like, It would be nice if we had a.

02:52.890 --> 02:56.220
Message whenever the service started up.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.210
And I'll create the pull request.

03:01.350 --> 03:06.690
So once I create that pull request, it triggers a new event on GitHub and that event should trigger

03:06.690 --> 03:09.420
the GitHub action or that workflow we just put together.

03:09.720 --> 03:14.040
So after a moment or two, you should see the box down here start to light up or change.

03:14.250 --> 03:17.970
It should go over to yellow and it should say something like some checks haven't completed yet.

03:18.710 --> 03:21.330
So that is our GitHub action being executed.

03:21.350 --> 03:25.820
In theory, it's going to run our tests and give us some output on those tests right here inside this

03:25.820 --> 03:30.050
window to get more information about what's going on, we can click on details on the right.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.800
And it's going to take us to some information about the running job.

03:34.370 --> 03:38.090
So in this case, it has is going through essentially the script we just put together.

03:38.090 --> 03:43.610
You can see that right now it is running the CD and to off and install and NPM run test command.

03:44.850 --> 03:49.890
So after it has installed all those dependencies, it's going to run all of our tests and hopefully

03:49.890 --> 03:50.940
they all pass.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.550
If they pass, then this step will be resolved successfully.

03:53.550 --> 03:57.570
Otherwise, if they fail for some reason, well, the overall test suite is going to fail and we'll

03:57.570 --> 04:00.180
be told about that back inside of our request.

04:00.660 --> 04:03.450
So looks like in this case all my tests ran successfully.

04:03.450 --> 04:05.220
So I get a green checkbox right there.

04:05.460 --> 04:08.340
Green checkbox right here to say everything looks good.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.130
So if I go back over to the Conversation tab.

04:13.390 --> 04:15.580
Which is essentially the main polar request tab.

04:15.850 --> 04:20.200
I'll now see something that says all checks have passed, so that would be assigned to you and I as

04:20.200 --> 04:25.600
developers, that the changes I just made didn't break anything inside of our app and we should be safe

04:25.600 --> 04:28.870
to now merge this pull request into our master branch.

04:29.350 --> 04:33.670
So I could click on merge pull request right there, but I'm not going to right now.

04:33.700 --> 04:37.240
I want to show you what would happen if one of our tests failed for some reason as well.

04:38.640 --> 04:39.090
Okay.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.380
So let's take a pause right here.

04:40.380 --> 04:40.810
When we come back.

04:40.830 --> 04:45.750
Next video, we're going to take a look at what happens if one of our test failure fail during this

04:45.750 --> 04:47.280
pull request process.
