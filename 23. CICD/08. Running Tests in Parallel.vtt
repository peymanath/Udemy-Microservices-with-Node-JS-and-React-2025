00:01.250 --> 00:06.350
Our GitHub workflow is looking pretty good, but right now it is only running tests inside of our service.

00:06.380 --> 00:10.610
We definitely need to make sure that we run tests inside of all of our other services as well.

00:10.910 --> 00:15.230
There's two ways that we can implement some additional configuration to run tests inside of our other

00:15.230 --> 00:16.010
services.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.520
First, I'm going to go back to the code tab on GitHub.

00:20.670 --> 00:26.340
You'll notice inside of your there's a new folder of GitHub workflows that is all of where all of our

00:26.340 --> 00:28.710
different workflow configuration files get saved.

00:29.420 --> 00:34.370
If we open up the test, one that is the workflow, we just created a moment to go.

00:34.790 --> 00:39.230
So there are two different ways that we can make sure that we run tests in all of our other services.

00:39.500 --> 00:44.180
We can either add in some additional run statements to this thing so we can make sure that we've run

00:44.180 --> 00:48.830
some more commands, like change into the orders directory, install dependencies, and then run tests

00:48.830 --> 00:53.390
inside there and then have another line for the ticket service, another for expiration, another for

00:53.390 --> 00:54.530
payments and so on.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.880
That is definitely one way to do it, but that is going to make sure that we run all of our tests in

00:58.880 --> 00:59.720
series.

00:59.750 --> 01:04.250
In other words, we're going to run all the tests for the auth service first and then expiration and

01:04.250 --> 01:06.350
then orders and then tickets and so on.

01:06.830 --> 01:11.090
In total, it might end up taking several minutes to run all the different tests for our project.

01:11.530 --> 01:16.460
Well, there's technically another way that we could wire up all of these testing workflows to make

01:16.460 --> 01:18.110
them all run in parallel.

01:18.590 --> 01:24.020
We can create some additional workflows that also execute on the on pull request event.

01:24.380 --> 01:29.330
And for each of these additional workflows we can create, we'll have them change into each of our other

01:29.330 --> 01:31.910
individual services and run tests inside them.

01:32.920 --> 01:37.960
So essentially for each individual service we can create a different GitHub action and that's going

01:37.960 --> 01:42.730
to make sure that they all run in parallel or essentially at the same time, which is going to dramatically

01:42.730 --> 01:44.770
speed up our testing process.

01:46.060 --> 01:49.780
So with that in mind, we're going to go through all of our different services, create a different

01:49.780 --> 01:51.370
workflow file for each of them.

01:52.130 --> 01:56.420
I'm going to first begin by opening up or directly editing this file on GitHub.

01:56.630 --> 02:01.400
I just want to change the name of the file and the name of the workflow step, just to make sure that

02:01.400 --> 02:05.930
it's really clear that this is a set of tests for running the test in the service.

02:06.350 --> 02:08.030
So click on the edit this file.

02:09.770 --> 02:14.570
I'm going to change the name right here to s dash off.

02:15.450 --> 02:18.000
I'll change the name of the file as well to test the.

02:22.020 --> 02:23.580
I'll then commit these changes.

02:27.190 --> 02:31.600
I'm then going to copy everything inside of here, and we're going to create a couple of extra files

02:31.600 --> 02:34.490
for all of our other services that actually have tests inside them.

02:34.510 --> 02:39.340
Again, this is to get all these different tests to run in parallel whenever we create a pull request

02:39.340 --> 02:40.690
or merge in changes.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.210
So inside of my workflows directory I'll click on the workflows link.

02:44.450 --> 02:46.520
I'm going to manually create a new file.

02:47.790 --> 02:50.820
I'll give the file a name of tests orders.

02:51.930 --> 02:52.440
HTML.

02:53.420 --> 02:55.580
And I'll paste in all the stuff that we just copied.

02:56.870 --> 02:59.690
I'll then change tests off to test orders.

03:01.130 --> 03:06.230
And down inside this run step, I'll update it to change into the orders directory instead.

03:08.770 --> 03:12.040
I'll then go down to the bottom and commit those changes.

03:14.810 --> 03:15.380
All right.

03:15.890 --> 03:20.030
Now, really quick, one thing I want to mention here is that we never actually put together any test

03:20.030 --> 03:21.800
inside of our expiration service.

03:22.190 --> 03:26.930
So the only other services we have to create a workflow file for, besides off and orders which we just

03:26.930 --> 03:29.270
created, is payments and tickets.

03:29.270 --> 03:32.720
So we're going to create two other workflow files, one for tickets and one for payments.

03:33.050 --> 03:34.490
Let's take care of payments first.

03:34.940 --> 03:39.830
So again, inside of my workflows directory, I'll create a new file of test dash.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.000
Payments that eml.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.170
Well, then paste all that stuff in.

03:47.190 --> 03:50.130
I'll change the name right there to test payments.

03:50.980 --> 03:54.820
And I'll change the CD right there as well to payments.

03:56.680 --> 03:56.980
Okay.

03:57.010 --> 03:58.090
Go down to the bottom.

03:58.860 --> 03:59.460
Save it.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.250
And then just one more.

04:02.460 --> 04:06.510
We'll create another file of tests, tickets, html.

04:07.430 --> 04:11.090
Do the paste tests, dash tickets.

04:12.350 --> 04:15.830
And then change CD off into CD tickets.

04:17.990 --> 04:21.050
And then finally go down to the bottom and commit.

04:22.570 --> 04:22.960
Okay.

04:22.990 --> 04:27.940
So now we should, whenever we create a pull request, push changes to a polar request, run all for

04:27.940 --> 04:31.240
these jobs in parallel, which would significantly speed up our run.

04:31.630 --> 04:35.800
Before we test this, however, we do need to make sure that we go around to our orders, payments and

04:35.800 --> 04:39.790
tickets projects and add in that test colon CI script to each of them.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.410
So back inside, my editor.

04:43.850 --> 04:48.110
Or excuse me first inside of our terminal, let's make sure that we're making these changes to the master

04:48.110 --> 04:48.770
branch.

04:49.220 --> 04:51.980
So I'm going to change back over to Master first.

04:53.180 --> 04:53.940
Then I'll go back over.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.030
Technically, that didn't matter.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.680
We could have just made the changes while we were on the dev branch and then check out master.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.130
But whatever.

04:58.130 --> 05:02.840
I just want to make the point that we want to make these changes to the master branch.

05:02.840 --> 05:07.850
So now we're going to go around to our orders, payments and ticket services and add in that new test

05:07.850 --> 05:08.490
command.

05:08.510 --> 05:14.300
So first off, inside of orders, I'll find the package JSON file and I'll add in test CI.

05:15.980 --> 05:16.730
Just.

05:17.830 --> 05:17.980
Okay.

05:18.100 --> 05:18.640
There's one.

05:18.640 --> 05:19.990
I'll save the file and close it.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.060
Next up is payments.

05:24.530 --> 05:26.780
Stop it in test, Cy.

05:27.510 --> 05:29.430
Just save it.

05:30.660 --> 05:32.700
And then last one, our ticket service.

05:34.920 --> 05:35.610
Test.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.220
Sigh.

05:40.180 --> 05:42.010
Just and save it.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.890
All right, so let's save that.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.650
Well, then go back over to our terminal.

05:49.160 --> 05:53.060
We're going to commit these three change packages on files and then push them up.

05:53.690 --> 05:54.830
They'll do a get add.

05:56.010 --> 05:58.530
I need to make sure I add everything from my root project directory.

05:58.530 --> 06:00.470
I cannot add from directly inside of off.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.850
I'll do a get add from ticketing.

06:03.180 --> 06:06.660
Now if I do a get status, I should see those three files added.

06:08.350 --> 06:12.670
All commit those changes with the message of added test script.

06:13.800 --> 06:17.610
And before we try to push these changes, we did just make a change to our master branch.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.470
So we have to pull those changes down first.

06:19.890 --> 06:22.560
So I'll do a get pull origin master.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.570
That's going to merge in those changes.

06:26.570 --> 06:28.970
Once again, you're going to be prompted with an editor.

06:28.970 --> 06:30.650
You can just close the editor out.

06:31.970 --> 06:34.190
Merge those changes in and now I can push these up.

06:34.190 --> 06:36.590
So get push origin master.

06:40.550 --> 06:40.910
All right.

06:40.910 --> 06:44.990
Just to make sure that we are totally on the same page at this point in time, we should be able to

06:44.990 --> 06:51.200
go back over to GitHub, refresh our repository, see all four workflow files inside the master branch

06:51.200 --> 06:54.560
in the GitHub workflows file folder.

06:55.080 --> 07:00.590
And I should be able to also go back over to my main ticketing directory, go into, say, the payments

07:00.590 --> 07:06.620
service, take a look at the package JSON file and see the test CI script inside there.

07:06.620 --> 07:10.610
And you should be able to see that test CI script inside of the orders payments.

07:10.610 --> 07:12.350
Tickets, services package.

07:12.350 --> 07:13.370
JSON files.

07:14.170 --> 07:14.470
All right.

07:14.470 --> 07:15.920
So we've taken a long time here.

07:15.940 --> 07:17.220
So let's now take a pause.

07:17.230 --> 07:18.490
We're going to come back the next video.

07:18.490 --> 07:20.840
Make one more change to our dev branch.

07:20.860 --> 07:25.570
Push it up and then make sure that we run all the tests over our entire project in parallel.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.820
So we'll take care of that in just a moment.
