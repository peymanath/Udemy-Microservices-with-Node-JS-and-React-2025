00:01.640 --> 00:01.940
All right.

00:01.940 --> 00:02.810
So moment of truth.

00:02.810 --> 00:05.770
We're now going to make another change on our debt branch.

00:05.780 --> 00:09.920
We're going to push it up to GitHub and expect to see all the tests inside of our service being ran

00:09.920 --> 00:10.700
in parallel.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.090
So in this case, I'm going to open up my order service.

00:14.150 --> 00:20.360
I'll open up the index file, and at the very top of my start function, I'll add in a console log of

00:20.360 --> 00:21.080
starting.

00:21.380 --> 00:25.850
So that is the change that I want to add in to my polar request that I still have running.

00:26.390 --> 00:27.350
So I'm going to save the file.

00:27.350 --> 00:28.130
Close it out.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.720
I'm going to go backward to my terminal.

00:31.960 --> 00:36.400
I'm going to check out my dev branch because remember, I want to make this change on the dev branch.

00:37.350 --> 00:39.300
So get check out Dev.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.780
I'm going to add that change.

00:41.810 --> 00:44.270
I'll do a get status just to make sure I successfully added it.

00:44.270 --> 00:44.570
Yep.

00:44.570 --> 00:45.740
Looks like I got it on there.

00:47.760 --> 00:55.380
Commit it, and I'll give this one a message as something like Add startup message to order service.

00:56.250 --> 00:59.370
And then I will push that to Origin Dev.

01:02.740 --> 01:03.100
All right.

01:03.100 --> 01:07.540
So we should now be able to flip back over to that pull request we had created and see all these different

01:07.540 --> 01:09.250
workflows running at the same time.

01:09.610 --> 01:11.140
I'll go to my pull request tab.

01:11.230 --> 01:13.330
I'll go to added startup message.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.020
And now if I go down to latest commits, I'll see all four workflows running in parallel.

01:19.380 --> 01:24.030
Now, just so you know, I've noticed that the very first time that you run or add in a workflow, sometimes

01:24.030 --> 01:26.500
GitHub doesn't really want to process it right away.

01:26.520 --> 01:32.070
So if you just sit here and wait for a while and don't see any progress being made or if some of the

01:32.070 --> 01:36.240
or one of these is just stuck in a this check has started or something like that state for 5 minutes

01:36.240 --> 01:39.120
or so, then you can always click on details.

01:40.070 --> 01:45.110
We can cancel workflow on the right hand side and then make another change to your local repository

01:45.110 --> 01:45.940
on the dev branch.

01:45.950 --> 01:48.230
Push it back up and let these things run again.

01:48.380 --> 01:52.100
Again, you only have to do that if it looks like everything has stalled out for about 5 minutes or

01:52.100 --> 01:52.580
so.

01:53.820 --> 01:54.180
Okay.

01:54.180 --> 01:59.520
So it looks like my orders tests have passed successfully and I can easily click around, take a look

01:59.520 --> 02:00.780
at the auth tests.

02:01.290 --> 02:02.660
Looks like those are still running.

02:02.670 --> 02:04.380
I can take a look at the payments tests.

02:04.920 --> 02:05.130
Yep.

02:05.130 --> 02:09.360
Looks like those are running as well, but also looks like some of them are starting to be resolved.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.180
So I'm going to go back to my polar request itself.

02:12.840 --> 02:13.890
Here's the pull request.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.250
And I'll just wait here.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.310
And after a minute or two, after all the tests run.

02:18.320 --> 02:18.660
Yep.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.820
Looks like we're good to go.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.110
So I've now ran all the different tests across all of my different services.

02:23.120 --> 02:26.120
They ran rather quickly because they all ran in parallel.

02:26.150 --> 02:30.590
And now I can safely merge this pilot request in because I'm pretty confident that, hey, I've made

02:30.590 --> 02:33.650
some changes and I have not broken anything inside my application.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.160
Okay, so this looks good.

02:36.160 --> 02:40.150
And we've now taken care of this workflow all the way up to the point where.

02:41.750 --> 02:43.940
We have all of our test passing now.

02:43.940 --> 02:50.330
In theory, if we merge this PR into the master branch, we want to somehow take this updated master

02:50.330 --> 02:53.780
branch and somehow deploy these changes.

02:54.350 --> 02:58.970
That's going be the next big thing we start to work on actually deploying our code after merging IPR

02:58.970 --> 03:00.290
into the master branch.
