00:01.280 --> 00:03.620
In the last video, we created our first GitHub hook.

00:03.650 --> 00:05.620
We're now going to try to test this thing out.

00:05.630 --> 00:10.950
So our ultimate goal is to be able to create a pull request and see all the tests for specifically our

00:11.180 --> 00:12.740
service get executed.

00:13.010 --> 00:17.000
Now, one thing I want to point out is that inside this little script we put in NPM, run test, colon

00:17.030 --> 00:17.560
PSI.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.410
So why is that?

00:18.860 --> 00:23.420
Well, whenever we run our tests inside of this GitHub environment, we need to make sure that our test

00:23.420 --> 00:25.940
suite exits automatically at some point in time.

00:26.390 --> 00:31.820
Right now, our NPM run test command is going to start up just inside the watcher mode.

00:31.820 --> 00:35.690
So it's going to run continuously just watching for changes to be made to our source code.

00:35.930 --> 00:38.180
We do not want that when we're running our tests on GitHub.

00:38.180 --> 00:41.930
We want just one run of our test suite and we want to exit entirely.

00:42.290 --> 00:47.420
So rather than running NPM test directory directly, we're going to instead create a new script called

00:47.420 --> 00:48.710
Test Colon PSI.

00:48.740 --> 00:52.700
That is going to run our test suite exactly one time and then automatically exit.

00:53.060 --> 00:56.480
So let's go back over to our service and make that change very quickly.

00:57.110 --> 01:00.050
Inside my service, I'll find the package dot JSON file.

01:01.970 --> 01:08.080
I'll find the script section inside there and I'm going to add in a new script of Test Colon Sci.

01:09.980 --> 01:10.790
And the command for that.

01:10.790 --> 01:12.020
We're going to put it in jest.

01:12.350 --> 01:13.580
And we actually don't even need that.

01:13.580 --> 01:15.110
No cache command on there at all.

01:15.140 --> 01:19.490
We definitely do not want watch all as you imagine, that's what starts up our test suite in the watcher

01:19.490 --> 01:19.970
mode.

01:20.810 --> 01:21.950
So then save this.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.110
We're going to go over to our terminal.

01:24.110 --> 01:28.100
We're going to commit these changes on the master branch because this is some initial configuration

01:28.100 --> 01:28.880
we're going through.

01:28.910 --> 01:32.690
Then we're going to push this up to GitHub and then after that we'll make some other small change to

01:32.690 --> 01:37.340
our project to kind of simulate making a change this thing in the real world, and then push it up to

01:37.340 --> 01:39.380
GitHub and walk through our entire workflow.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.060
So back over at my terminal.

01:43.180 --> 01:44.110
I'll do a get status.

01:44.110 --> 01:45.340
Take a look at the files.

01:45.340 --> 01:45.970
I've changed.

01:46.270 --> 01:47.950
Just that package stays on file.

01:48.660 --> 01:50.970
So I'll add that and then commit it.

01:53.970 --> 01:54.990
But the message.

01:55.950 --> 01:59.070
And then finally, I'm going to push this up once again to the master branch.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.560
So get push origin master.

02:03.470 --> 02:04.100
And.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.060
All right, my mistake.

02:05.060 --> 02:07.760
We just made a change on GitHub to the master branch.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.830
We have to pull those changes down first.

02:10.010 --> 02:12.980
We need to do a git pull or origin master.

02:13.130 --> 02:14.060
That's better.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.190
You're probably going to see a little Ed pop up asking you to provide a merge message to go through

02:21.190 --> 02:21.970
that process.

02:21.970 --> 02:26.650
And then once we merge everything, then we can do a get push origin master.

02:30.940 --> 02:32.290
All right, so there's our changes.

02:32.290 --> 02:36.190
So now in theory, our GitHub workflow is all ready to be tested.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.500
Let's pause once more, come back in next video.

02:38.500 --> 02:42.220
Try making a change and simulate the real workflow that we're going to go through.
