00:00.730 --> 00:04.090
I have now purchased the ticketing app for XYZ domain.

00:04.270 --> 00:09.790
I'm now on the named Cheap Configuration page where I can make changes to how this domain name behaves.

00:10.300 --> 00:13.210
On this page, there's really just one setting that we want to change.

00:13.360 --> 00:18.940
We're going to find something around name servers or DNS servers depending upon the provider you purchase

00:18.940 --> 00:20.200
your domain name from.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.830
This setting is going to be somewhere slightly different by default.

00:23.830 --> 00:27.220
You're probably using some kind of basic or preset DNS.

00:27.430 --> 00:32.710
We are going to update this to a setting of custom DNS and then we're going to enter in three custom

00:32.710 --> 00:33.700
name servers.

00:34.610 --> 00:38.420
The first one we are going to enter here is ns one digital ocean.

00:39.960 --> 00:48.150
And as to digital ocean dot com or then going to add one more and put in GNS three digital ocean dot

00:48.150 --> 00:48.600
com.

00:49.800 --> 00:53.400
I'll then click the green checkmark on the right hand side to save those changes.

00:54.390 --> 00:59.370
And after a quick refresh, this should eventually say, yeah, something like that right there.

00:59.370 --> 01:01.860
So we should have one, two and three digital ocean.

01:04.070 --> 01:08.300
Once we've made those changes, we're then going to go back over to our Digital Ocean Dashboard.

01:08.900 --> 01:12.890
We're going to find the networking tab once again and then click on domains.

01:13.990 --> 01:17.100
We'll enter in our domain name right here, the one you just purchased.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.760
So for me, it is going to be.

01:20.270 --> 01:22.610
Ticketing app, product X, Y, Z.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.890
I'm going to enter in right there.

01:28.260 --> 01:28.970
There we go.

01:28.980 --> 01:30.240
And then add domain.

01:33.310 --> 01:38.500
Once we add that domain, we're going to be prompted for a couple of different settings so we can add

01:38.500 --> 01:41.740
in some new records to customize exactly how this domain name behaves.

01:43.660 --> 01:45.970
We are going to enter in two additional records.

01:46.450 --> 01:49.970
The first record we're going to add in is going to be an A record.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.420
So I'm going to enter in and at right there.

01:53.240 --> 01:58.610
And then going to click on this will direct to box and I'm going to click on my load balancer that was

01:58.610 --> 01:59.480
just created.

01:59.510 --> 02:03.920
Now if you forget the name of your load balancer, you can always open up that networking tab once again

02:04.190 --> 02:06.170
and go over to the Load Balancers tab.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.560
The name of my load balancer is a7b0 AF.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.250
So on this dropdown I'm going to find a7b, a0f.

02:15.270 --> 02:16.440
There it is right there.

02:17.690 --> 02:21.620
And then going to change the time to life down to 30 seconds.

02:22.700 --> 02:23.920
And I'll create the record.

02:26.140 --> 02:28.050
After that, we're going to create one other record.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.070
I'm going to click on See Name at the top.

02:30.580 --> 02:31.840
I'll then enter in w.

02:31.840 --> 02:32.860
W w.

02:33.710 --> 02:38.840
And then four is an alias of we're going to put in that like so.

02:39.650 --> 02:44.040
I then go to change the time to live also to 30 seconds and create the record.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.430
And that should be it.

02:47.300 --> 02:52.510
So now we need to go back over to our ingress engine X config file and we need to make sure that we

02:52.510 --> 02:56.890
tell it that whenever it's running in production mode, we want it to watch for requests coming in to

02:56.890 --> 03:01.810
a domain of ticketing app, product, XYZ or whatever your domain name is.

03:02.670 --> 03:05.070
So for that, I'm going to go back over to my editor.

03:07.750 --> 03:12.160
I'm going to find my ingress service file inside of the prod directory.

03:12.700 --> 03:16.630
Then on the host right here, we're going to delete ticketing, dot dev or whatever host you were using

03:16.630 --> 03:19.420
locally and will replace it with our new domain name.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.230
We're also going to add in w w to the very start as well.

03:23.230 --> 03:26.020
We should have w w w your domain name.

03:26.810 --> 03:31.160
We're then going to save this file and we're going to go through that exact same series of changes that

03:31.160 --> 03:35.930
we go through or the same flow where we have to commit these changes, push it up to our dev branch,

03:35.930 --> 03:38.750
create the pull request, and approve the polar request.

03:39.670 --> 03:40.930
The back over at my terminal.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.050
I'll do a get status while on the dev branch.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.560
I'll make sure that I've got the change to the k aids directory.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.320
I'll then add the change and commit it.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.830
I'll push it up to GitHub.

03:59.070 --> 04:03.030
And then after I pushed it, I'll go over to GitHub itself and create a new pull request.

04:05.340 --> 04:05.460
Okay.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.340
So over on GitHub.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.310
I'll go to my polar request tab.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.750
I will create a new request.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.790
And again, we want to go from Dev into the master branch.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.490
So I should be able to take a look and make sure that.

04:19.490 --> 04:21.680
Yep, I've got my domain name inside there.

04:22.590 --> 04:23.910
I'll create the pull request.

04:25.870 --> 04:29.800
They're not going to be any tests that are going to run because we don't have any tests around our infra

04:29.800 --> 04:30.520
directory.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.250
So we should be able to merge this request right away.

04:35.610 --> 04:39.720
After we merge the request, we can then go up to our actions tab.

04:40.630 --> 04:44.800
We should see our workflow or deploy manifests running right now.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.510
So I'm going to click on that.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.210
I'll click on the build tab.

04:50.170 --> 04:53.830
And then we should see once again doctor being installed configured.

04:54.370 --> 04:56.680
We should then be applying all of our manifests.

04:56.680 --> 05:00.790
So there's the big application right there and it looks like everything is green.

05:01.580 --> 05:03.690
So we're now going to wait for a little bit.

05:03.710 --> 05:08.270
It usually takes about maybe ten, 15 minutes for all the changes that we just made to that domain,

05:08.300 --> 05:10.580
domain name to actually go live.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.020
In theory, it should be faster.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.990
But I'm going to tell you, you should probably wait about ten or 15 minutes.

05:15.560 --> 05:19.760
After that, we're then going to try to navigate to our domain name inside the browser and make sure

05:19.760 --> 05:21.080
that we can see our application.

05:21.590 --> 05:23.220
So I'm going to wait for a couple of minutes right now.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.240
I'll come back the next video and we're going to test out our domain.
