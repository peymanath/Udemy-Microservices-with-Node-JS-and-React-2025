00:01.710 --> 00:06.570
We've got our script in a pretty good spot, so I'm now going to commit this file by going to the green

00:06.570 --> 00:09.690
button on the top right hand side and commit new file.

00:12.040 --> 00:12.190
Okay.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.410
So we've now got this new workflow put together.

00:14.440 --> 00:19.360
Now, any time that we emerge in April, we should see it that we are going to build a new image and

00:19.360 --> 00:20.650
push it off to Docker Hub.

00:21.040 --> 00:25.000
To test this out right now, we can go back over to that polar request we had already created.

00:25.770 --> 00:27.930
So here's the one I made a little bit ago.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.870
This definitely contains a change to our service.

00:33.140 --> 00:37.490
So as soon as we merge this, we should see that new workflow that we just put together run for the

00:37.490 --> 00:40.310
first time, build the image, and push it to Docker Hub.

00:41.310 --> 00:45.060
So to really test this out, we'll go down to the bottom, merge the pull request.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.700
And then after merging it.

00:51.210 --> 00:55.440
We should be able to go to the very top, go to actions.

00:58.740 --> 01:01.380
We're going to see a new entry in the list of actions right here.

01:01.380 --> 01:04.170
So it looks like it's running by deploy auth workflow.

01:04.410 --> 01:07.650
I'm going to click on that and then click on build on the left hand side.

01:09.390 --> 01:11.340
I'll then see the log of everything it's going through.

01:11.340 --> 01:14.970
So it looks like it's already built up the image and the time that it took me just to click over here.

01:15.690 --> 01:17.370
It looks like it then logged into what?

01:17.370 --> 01:18.540
Docker successfully?

01:20.560 --> 01:25.300
And then finally it looks like it is in the process of pushing the image off to Docker Hub.

01:25.690 --> 01:30.370
At this point, if you see any errors during that step or that step right there, the log in, specifically

01:30.370 --> 01:32.490
the log in, see any errors around that?

01:32.500 --> 01:35.470
Chances are there is a typo inside of your script.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.300
So I would encourage you to go back, double check it.

01:37.300 --> 01:42.790
Also make sure that you set up the Docker username and password secrets inside the repo successfully

01:42.790 --> 01:43.420
as well.

01:44.650 --> 01:44.890
All right.

01:44.890 --> 01:50.470
So it's been a while now, but hopefully this little darker push step will eventually go through.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.430
I'm not going to make you sit here and watch this.

01:52.490 --> 01:53.500
Let's take a pause right here.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.020
Hopefully the next video, I'll be able to come back and confirm that.

01:56.020 --> 01:57.710
Yeah, everything got pushed off.

01:57.730 --> 01:58.720
Oh, sure enough.

01:58.720 --> 01:59.380
There we go.

01:59.740 --> 02:00.520
It got pushed.

02:00.850 --> 02:01.990
So it looks like that's it.

02:01.990 --> 02:06.160
I've built up the image and pushed it off to Docker Hub, so that is awesome.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.440
It is great progress.

02:07.450 --> 02:09.940
We've now got our new image off on Docker Hub.

02:10.210 --> 02:16.390
Now all we have to do is figure out how to somehow tell our Kubernetes cluster to use this new image

02:16.390 --> 02:17.650
we have just built.

02:17.890 --> 02:19.930
We also, of course, have to make sure.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.870
That we reapply or we apply this infrared directory at some point as well.

02:25.170 --> 02:30.000
So really two more steps and we can make sure that the service is up and running inside of our cluster.
