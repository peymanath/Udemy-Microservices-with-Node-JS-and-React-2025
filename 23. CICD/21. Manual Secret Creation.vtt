00:01.630 --> 00:06.250
In this video, we're going to create two secrets that are required for our application to run inside

00:06.250 --> 00:07.810
of our digital ocean cluster.

00:08.260 --> 00:14.140
So the two secrets we have to provide are a secret named JWT secret, and that's going to contain a

00:14.140 --> 00:15.620
property of JWT.

00:16.090 --> 00:20.220
And the other one that I had completely forgot in the last video was Stripe secret.

00:20.230 --> 00:23.950
And that's going to contain a secret or a property called Stripe Underscore Key.

00:24.970 --> 00:29.560
If you forget where that stripe key comes from, remember, you're going to go to Dashboard Stripe.

00:30.520 --> 00:35.710
On the left hand side, we can find developers, API keys and then we're going to look for Secret Key.

00:35.710 --> 00:39.460
Right there you can click Reveal Test Key Token to show your key.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.710
So once we get that key, we're going to create our two secrets.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.900
And remember, we create secrets from the command line.

00:48.620 --> 00:54.470
So back at the command line, we're going to use Q CTL to access our digital ocean cluster.

00:54.650 --> 01:01.130
That means we need to make sure that our CTL is configured to use our context for digital ocean.

01:01.910 --> 01:04.330
Get a reminder on what context you're using right now.

01:04.340 --> 01:09.890
You can very easily go back up to your system, tray, take a look at Kubernetes and see which one you're

01:09.890 --> 01:10.730
connected to.

01:11.150 --> 01:17.180
Alternatively, if you are not using Docker desktop, remember you can always do a cube CTL config view.

01:17.970 --> 01:20.220
That's going to show you all the different things you're running.

01:21.340 --> 01:22.690
We can look at contexts.

01:23.380 --> 01:25.810
I want to find my digital ocean context.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.100
That's my name right there.

01:28.450 --> 01:35.740
I'll then do a cube ctrl config use context and I'll paste in the name of my digital ocean context.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.720
And that switches me over.

01:39.760 --> 01:44.150
So now we're going to run the command to manually create a secret on our digital ocean cluster.

01:44.450 --> 01:47.060
Well, first, create the JSON web token secret.

01:47.090 --> 01:47.950
We're going to do a cube.

01:48.230 --> 01:50.570
It'll create secret.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.700
Then generic.

01:54.910 --> 01:58.990
Then the name of our secret which is JWT secret.

01:59.860 --> 02:02.200
Then dash dash from literal.

02:03.450 --> 02:04.220
Equals.

02:04.230 --> 02:08.010
And then we're going to enter in our key value pair right here without any spaces.

02:08.370 --> 02:13.110
So our key is supposed to be JWT underscore key equals.

02:13.260 --> 02:18.090
And then whatever value we want to assign to this, remember it is supposed to be a random stream of

02:18.090 --> 02:21.030
characters that are going to somehow sign our JSON web tokens.

02:21.180 --> 02:25.230
So I'm going to enter in just some random stream characters like so and that should be good enough.

02:26.250 --> 02:27.210
Kate looks good.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.720
Now we'll create our second secret for the Stripe key.

02:31.020 --> 02:36.390
This one is supposed to have a name of Stripe secret, and then a key of Stripe key.

02:37.690 --> 02:41.410
And then finally, our value once again is going to come from our dashboard back over here.

02:44.120 --> 02:51.140
So back over at our terminal, we're going to do a CTL create secret generic.

02:51.470 --> 02:53.930
The name of the secret is going to be Stripe secret.

02:54.980 --> 02:57.290
Well then specify from literal.

02:58.420 --> 02:59.290
Equals.

02:59.380 --> 03:04.690
The key that we want to set inside this secret is strip underscore key, and then the value of that

03:04.690 --> 03:08.110
is going to be the key off of our stripe dashboard itself.

03:08.740 --> 03:13.900
Now, once again, extremely important that you type out this secret exactly as I show it.

03:14.050 --> 03:16.240
So make sure the Secret's name is Stripe secret.

03:16.480 --> 03:21.100
Make sure you've got a key inside there of Stripe Key and a value of your secret key.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.860
Once we've got that all put together, we'll run that.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.470
And we should see that the secret was created.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.110
Okay, so this looks good.

03:29.290 --> 03:34.270
Now, the last thing we really have to do before we do a quick test of merging in a request, we have

03:34.270 --> 03:36.900
to do a little bit of setup on ingress and X.

03:36.910 --> 03:38.950
So we're going to take care of that in just a moment.
