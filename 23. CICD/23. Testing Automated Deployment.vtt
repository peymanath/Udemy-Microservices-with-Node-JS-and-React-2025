00:01.050 --> 00:01.380
Okay.

00:01.410 --> 00:04.080
Time for a real test of our application.

00:04.110 --> 00:06.020
So we're going to make a change to our service.

00:06.030 --> 00:08.130
We're going to commit that to the dev branch.

00:08.130 --> 00:11.280
We're then going to create a pull request and merge it into master.

00:11.370 --> 00:16.560
When we merge it into master, GitHub should automatically build our image and tell our Kubernetes cluster

00:16.560 --> 00:20.010
or specifically the deployment to use that new image.

00:20.250 --> 00:24.990
Now, as a quick reminder, we have not set up any networking or anything like that around our cluster

00:24.990 --> 00:25.710
just yet.

00:25.710 --> 00:30.390
So we will not be able to access our application inside the browser until we do a little bit more setup.

00:30.690 --> 00:35.100
All we are trying to do right now is make sure that we can make a change to one of our services and

00:35.100 --> 00:37.440
get that change deployed into our cluster.

00:37.830 --> 00:38.940
So let's get to it.

00:39.360 --> 00:44.550
Inside my art service, I'm going to find the indexed file and on that little console log that we had

00:44.550 --> 00:47.280
added right there, I'm just going to add in a couple more dots.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.860
So that is the big change that we want to commit.

00:50.840 --> 00:51.730
So I'll make that change.

00:51.740 --> 00:52.850
I'm going to save the file.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.190
I'll then go back over to my terminal.

00:55.730 --> 00:58.670
I'm going to make sure that I'm on the dev branch.

00:59.770 --> 01:00.850
On the dev branch.

01:01.390 --> 01:03.250
I'll take a look at all my pending changes.

01:03.970 --> 01:10.570
I'm going to add that change, commit it and I'll give it a message of updated startup message.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.740
I'll then push that up to my dev branch.

01:19.770 --> 01:20.100
All right.

01:20.100 --> 01:20.820
Looks good.

01:21.250 --> 01:22.400
Let's now go over to GitHub.

01:22.410 --> 01:25.830
We're going to create a pull request and then merge it into master.

01:26.860 --> 01:28.210
So over on GitHub.

01:29.270 --> 01:30.890
I'll go to the pool request tab.

01:31.870 --> 01:37.600
I'm going to create a new pull request and I want to merge everything from Dev into master.

01:40.540 --> 01:41.920
I'm going to create the pull request.

01:47.560 --> 01:51.850
And then we're going to wait just a couple of seconds here for all of our tests to be executed.

01:52.890 --> 01:55.740
After a minute or two, you should see all of your tests pass.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.190
So in this case, there's really just one check being committed.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.300
It's just the test on the auth service.

02:00.660 --> 02:02.730
Now we're going to merge in this pull request.

02:04.020 --> 02:05.070
I'm going to merge it in.

02:06.090 --> 02:09.900
And now after merging it, we should be able to go over to our actions tab once again.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.880
So at the very top actions.

02:12.890 --> 02:15.320
We're then going to find deploy manifests.

02:15.680 --> 02:19.880
We're not going to see any changes inside of here just yet because we have not made any changes to any

02:19.880 --> 02:23.240
of the files inside the manifest directory or really the infra directory.

02:23.750 --> 02:28.520
However, we did make a change to the OTT service, so we should be able to open up, deploy off.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.860
And see our deployment script right there.

02:32.370 --> 02:33.750
I'm going to click on that task.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.690
I'm going to take a look at the build job inside there.

02:37.370 --> 02:41.870
And now we should be able to follow through as this goes and builds our image, which is the image of

02:41.870 --> 02:44.720
the Docker hub and then eventually deploys it into our cluster.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.790
So I'm going to pause the video right here.

02:46.800 --> 02:51.000
We're going to come back to the next video and just make sure that the deployment went as expected.
