00:01.460 --> 00:03.500
It's been about 15 or 20 minutes for me.

00:03.500 --> 00:08.660
So I'm now going to open up a new browser tab and try to navigate to my application at ticketing app

00:08.660 --> 00:11.960
product XYZ so I can open up a new browser.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.310
I'm going to navigate over there.

00:13.730 --> 00:17.660
And lo and behold, the application actually appears awesome.

00:17.870 --> 00:22.220
Now, as you can see, I've kind of recorded this video once or twice before, so there already is a

00:22.250 --> 00:23.930
ticket here that I have created.

00:24.620 --> 00:27.830
But once I'm here, I can definitely try to create a new account.

00:27.980 --> 00:30.290
I should be able to sign up with a new account.

00:34.860 --> 00:39.270
I should then be able to sell a ticket so I could put in something like.

00:40.020 --> 00:41.600
Football match.

00:41.610 --> 00:42.660
20 bucks.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.460
And there is my ticket right there.

00:45.460 --> 00:48.370
I can then view it and attempt to purchase it.

00:50.990 --> 00:52.910
I can get up that stripe window.

00:54.390 --> 00:57.990
One of my fake credit card number because our stripe account is still in test mode.

01:01.980 --> 01:04.800
And after that, I should be told that everything is good to go.

01:04.830 --> 01:05.160
Yeah.

01:05.190 --> 01:05.550
There we go.

01:05.550 --> 01:06.210
There's my ticket.

01:06.210 --> 01:07.020
Complete.

01:07.410 --> 01:09.060
So that is pretty much it.

01:09.390 --> 01:10.950
Our application is now deployed.

01:11.490 --> 01:14.340
So now if we ever want to make a change, the process.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.100
Well, we've gone through it several times now.

01:16.110 --> 01:20.970
We're going to make some changes on a branch, push those up to GitHub, make a pull request, merge

01:20.970 --> 01:21.810
that into master.

01:21.810 --> 01:25.370
As soon as we do, our new images will be built and applied to the cluster.

01:25.380 --> 01:25.890
That's it.

01:25.890 --> 01:27.600
That's how we make changes over time.

01:28.470 --> 01:30.120
That is pretty much it for this course.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.570
That is all the topics we are going to go over.

01:32.580 --> 01:36.660
But I'm sure you might be curious about how we can expand this application because, well, we're definitely

01:36.660 --> 01:38.310
kind of light on the styling side.

01:38.310 --> 01:42.210
We never really built in the idea of some transferable information about tickets.

01:42.210 --> 01:46.590
In other words, when you purchase a ticket, nothing really happens beyond saying, Hey, this is now

01:46.590 --> 01:49.770
assigned to you, so there might be some features you want to add in.

01:49.770 --> 01:51.090
So check out the next video.

01:51.090 --> 01:55.590
I'm going to put in a couple of notes on some things you can expand on in this application, along with

01:55.590 --> 01:57.900
some possible ways of implementing those steps.
