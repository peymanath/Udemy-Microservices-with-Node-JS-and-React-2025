WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:03.380
Our entire testing pipeline is looking pretty good.

00:03.380 --> 00:06.800
So we're now going to start to move on to the deployment of our application.

00:07.310 --> 00:11.660
The first thing we have to do to deploy our application is choose a hosting provider and create a new

00:11.660 --> 00:12.860
Kubernetes cluster.

00:13.220 --> 00:16.820
So we need to take a look at some of the different providers that are available, evaluate them, and

00:16.820 --> 00:18.560
eventually create a cluster itself.

00:19.040 --> 00:23.750
Before we discuss these providers at all, I do want to mention that a credit card is going to be required

00:23.750 --> 00:26.210
to move forward with one of these hosting providers.

00:26.420 --> 00:31.820
Every single one of them requires you to enter a credit card in order to run any kind of workload.

00:32.210 --> 00:34.220
You will need a credit card, without a doubt.

00:34.850 --> 00:38.600
In total, we're going to have to pay about a dollar or so to get a domain.

00:38.930 --> 00:42.350
We're also going to run or cost about $0.72 notice.

00:42.350 --> 00:43.340
That is sense right there.

00:43.340 --> 00:47.090
It is not $72 per day to run the cluster itself.

00:47.890 --> 00:53.800
Now for the provider that we are going to use, you can find coupon codes online and these coupon codes

00:53.800 --> 00:56.490
are generally worth about $60 or $100 or so.

00:56.500 --> 01:00.640
So at the end of the day, if you create a new account with the provider that we're going to use and

01:00.640 --> 01:05.440
you find a coupon code for it, you should probably be able to walk out of this with only paying $1

01:05.440 --> 01:06.970
for the domain name itself.

01:07.210 --> 01:10.450
And technically the domain name is somewhat optional.

01:10.450 --> 01:14.890
If you do not get the domain name, you will not be able to load up our application inside the browser,

01:14.890 --> 01:19.300
but you will be able to at least deploy it and verify that it is online and running.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.430
You just won't be able to access it in the browser.

01:22.790 --> 01:22.960
Okay.

01:23.030 --> 01:26.990
So with all that in mind, let's take a look at some of the different hosting providers we are going

01:26.990 --> 01:28.010
to have access to.

01:28.820 --> 01:33.720
So we're going to very briefly discuss four different providers on each of these providers.

01:33.740 --> 01:35.120
I really just have two metrics.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.730
The first is the cost to use this provider.

01:38.420 --> 01:43.880
And the cost for each of these and is in terms of month and for each month, I'm assuming that we have

01:43.880 --> 01:48.620
three individual nodes inside of our cluster, so three virtual machines and that each of those has

01:48.620 --> 01:51.170
two gigabytes of RAM and about one CPU.

01:51.650 --> 01:55.100
Some of these providers also have some extra costs associated with them.

01:55.100 --> 01:58.640
And so wherever possible, I included or lumped in some of those costs.

01:59.850 --> 02:01.500
And some of these providers as well.

02:01.500 --> 02:05.510
There is no option to get a VM with two gigabytes of RAM and one CPU.

02:05.520 --> 02:10.050
So I just did my best to kind of round out and figure out something kind of equivalent.

02:10.470 --> 02:14.970
What I'm trying to say here is that you should not use the exact numbers I've quoted in each of these

02:14.970 --> 02:17.100
as gospel or the exact value.

02:17.100 --> 02:21.630
Instead, they are kind of very rough estimates on what we might possibly end up paying.

02:23.150 --> 02:26.720
So with that in mind, let's take a look at our four hosting providers.

02:27.230 --> 02:32.030
The four big names out there right now are Digital Ocean eight, AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.

02:33.730 --> 02:34.300
Reach these.

02:34.300 --> 02:39.100
You can see very easily that digital ocean by far leads on price and AWS.

02:39.220 --> 02:42.100
Google Cloud are way more expensive.

02:43.080 --> 02:48.510
The reason for that is that a US and Google Cloud charged you money just to run a Kubernetes cluster

02:48.510 --> 02:51.000
without any virtual machines inside of it.

02:51.570 --> 02:56.670
So remember, whenever we run Kubernetes, we have what is called the master node or the control plane,

02:56.670 --> 02:58.080
as it's also referred to.

02:58.410 --> 03:03.450
This is a process that evaluates and watches your cluster and make sure that it is doing everything

03:03.450 --> 03:04.200
correctly.

03:04.350 --> 03:09.510
It monitors all the different pods, creates pods, great services, all that kind of good stuff.

03:10.350 --> 03:14.260
AWS and Google Cloud make you pay money just for that control plane.

03:14.280 --> 03:21.190
In total, it is $0.01 per hour and that actually really adds up very quickly, $0.01 per hour.

03:21.210 --> 03:22.140
Let's do the math here.

03:22.140 --> 03:25.320
So $0.01 or something, not $0.01 $0.10.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.240
So point one dollars.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.880
24 hours in a day at times 30 days.

03:30.900 --> 03:36.450
That is $72 a month that you are paying just to make use of eight of us or Google Cloud.

03:36.720 --> 03:41.520
That's a lot of money and that's why it's so much more expensive to make use of eight of us or Google

03:41.520 --> 03:44.970
Cloud for a very small, very simple Kubernetes cluster.

03:46.760 --> 03:51.260
Now personally, I would like to use Google Cloud because it's pretty darn easy to use.

03:51.290 --> 03:57.110
The UI is fantastic, monitoring is really easy and so on, but is a little bit more expensive.

03:57.110 --> 04:01.490
And we've kind of already touched on Google Cloud earlier on inside this course, so we're going to

04:01.490 --> 04:02.930
throw that out as an option.

04:03.870 --> 04:07.470
I also want to mention, as are over here really quickly, not to be totally honest with you, I have

04:07.470 --> 04:11.700
not used Kubernetes with Azure before, so I can't really give you a great opinion.

04:11.820 --> 04:16.860
I have had some great experiences with Azure in the past with non Kubernetes deployments.

04:17.190 --> 04:21.300
Nonetheless, I don't really have professional experience with it, so to be honest, we're not going

04:21.300 --> 04:25.050
to use it inside this course because I can't really do a good job of explaining the pros and cons of

04:25.050 --> 04:25.440
it.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.900
That really leaves digital ocean.

04:27.900 --> 04:32.910
And now from the colors I have here, I bet you can guess which one we're going to use.

04:33.390 --> 04:35.370
We're going to use digital ocean.

04:35.760 --> 04:40.050
I know that many people taking this course would love to see a trust me.

04:40.050 --> 04:40.770
I know.

04:40.770 --> 04:43.530
I know you want to see a s with Kubernetes.

04:43.530 --> 04:46.410
But let me just be really, really honest with you.

04:46.590 --> 04:50.820
This very well might be the first time that you are deploying something with Kubernetes.

04:51.060 --> 04:57.030
And if you are just getting started with Kubernetes, eight of us is almost definitely the worst possible

04:57.030 --> 04:58.950
deployment provider out there.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.390
Almost without a doubt.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.220
With the US.

05:02.230 --> 05:04.490
There is an incredible number of options.

05:04.510 --> 05:07.080
There's an incredible number of setup steps.

05:07.090 --> 05:11.560
There are incredible number of setup screens, a ton of UI, a ton of settings.

05:11.710 --> 05:17.170
All of it is extremely mysterious and all the documentation is rather poor.

05:17.680 --> 05:22.390
In addition, they also provide a Kubernetes offering that is kind of tangled quite a bit with another

05:22.390 --> 05:25.120
product they offer called a gate.

05:25.120 --> 05:29.400
And understanding what FAJ does is its own challenge in its own right.

05:29.410 --> 05:35.230
So if you are getting started with Kubernetes and deployment, I got to be honest with you, AWS is

05:35.230 --> 05:41.200
a really, really bad decision and I really recommend you try out an easier provider first.

05:41.200 --> 05:46.270
Just you understand the general process and then you can go and take a shot at a AWS.

05:46.810 --> 05:48.750
So that is my opinion on AWS.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.010
I'm sure there are people out there who disagree with me.

05:51.010 --> 05:53.830
Maybe they say, Hey, learn the hardest thing first or something like that.

05:53.830 --> 05:59.680
But my opinion is AWS is just a very bad place to get started with Kubernetes.

06:00.350 --> 06:02.660
So as you can imagine, yep, digital ocean.

06:02.660 --> 06:03.850
That's what we're going to use.

06:03.860 --> 06:05.480
It is by far the cheapest.

06:06.080 --> 06:10.070
It's also extremely easy to use, extremely easy.

06:10.580 --> 06:11.540
At some level.

06:11.540 --> 06:14.780
You're not even going to realize that we are running anything with digital ocean.

06:14.780 --> 06:19.010
It's going to feel like you're just accessing a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine.

06:19.010 --> 06:20.780
That's how easy it is going to end up being.

06:23.060 --> 06:24.610
Because we're going to use digital ocean.

06:24.620 --> 06:26.240
Let's go over to the website right now.

06:26.240 --> 06:30.170
We're going to make sure that you have an account and that you get signed up for one hook up billing

06:30.170 --> 06:31.370
and all that kind of stuff.

06:31.960 --> 06:35.490
So inside of a new browser tab, I'm going to navigate to Digital Ocean.

06:37.110 --> 06:38.690
And go ahead and sign up.

06:38.700 --> 06:42.690
And before you sign up, if you want to do it, you can do a quick Google search for something like

06:42.690 --> 06:49.560
digital ocean at coupon code and you probably are going to be able to find a $100 coupon code that essentially

06:49.560 --> 06:52.200
gives you $100 of credit with digital ocean.

06:52.620 --> 06:56.040
So if you want to pause video, go and find a coupon code like that.

06:56.190 --> 06:59.160
Click on it and then sign up for an account through that coupon.

06:59.610 --> 07:03.150
Otherwise, if you already have an account or if you just don't care about coupon code, just go ahead,

07:03.150 --> 07:04.050
create an account.

07:04.050 --> 07:05.280
And eventually.

07:06.700 --> 07:11.770
What we want to see is the main landing dashboard, which is going to look a little something like this.

07:12.250 --> 07:15.480
You might see a whole bunch of welcome screen or something like that.

07:15.490 --> 07:20.200
Basically, it just makes sure you create an account and get signed in as you sign in.

07:20.230 --> 07:24.610
You might be prompted to enter some billing information and if you are, make sure you enter your credit

07:24.610 --> 07:25.330
card number.

07:25.330 --> 07:29.680
In order to run our cluster, you will need a credit card associated with your account.

07:30.370 --> 07:32.400
So go ahead through that signup process.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.400
We're going to pause right here.

07:33.400 --> 07:38.110
And hopefully by the start of the next video, you'll end up at a screen somewhat similar to this right

07:38.110 --> 07:38.500
here.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.210
So I'll see you in just a minute.
