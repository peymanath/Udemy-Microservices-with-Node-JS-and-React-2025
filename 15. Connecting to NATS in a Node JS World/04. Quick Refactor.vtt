00:01.220 --> 00:06.110
We've now got our custom new ticket listener put together along with the base class of listener.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.990
At this point, there's something I really want to clarify very quickly.

00:09.170 --> 00:12.320
We have our base class of listener and a ticket created listener.

00:12.350 --> 00:16.970
The idea here is that we're going to define this listener class inside of our common module.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.600
Well, then import this into our different services we're going to eventually create.

00:20.750 --> 00:26.300
Then inside of each of our services, that is where we are going to actually subclass listener and create

00:26.300 --> 00:32.090
some custom listener that's going to work specifically for, say, the payment service or say the ticket

00:32.090 --> 00:34.760
service or whatever other service we are creating.

00:35.030 --> 00:36.620
So listener is just a blueprint.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.640
It is a guide on how to create a listener.

00:38.660 --> 00:43.220
We're going to actually implement these things with very custom logic inside of each of our services.

00:44.080 --> 00:44.320
All right.

00:44.320 --> 00:49.360
So with that out of the way, next thing I want to do, when we take a look at our listener file, there's

00:49.360 --> 00:52.870
a lot of code inside of here right now and it's really hard to figure out what is going on.

00:53.170 --> 00:57.880
Let's try redistributing some of the code into a couple of different files inside this project directory

00:57.880 --> 01:00.640
just to make all this stuff a little bit easier to understand.

01:01.790 --> 01:07.760
So inside the CRC folder, I'm going to first begin by creating a new folder called Events.

01:08.500 --> 01:12.310
Inside, they are going to make a new file called Base Listener TS.

01:12.760 --> 01:18.520
I would normally not use the name of base listener for this listener class we just put together, but

01:18.520 --> 01:21.130
we already have a file called Listener inside of our project.

01:21.130 --> 01:25.270
So rather than calling it listener and having two listener files, which would be really confusing,

01:25.270 --> 01:27.250
let's just give it a name of base listener.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.720
I'll then go back over to the listener file.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.570
I'm going to find the abstract class of listener.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.670
I'm going to cut that entire thing.

01:40.260 --> 01:42.570
And then I'll paste it into base listener.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.930
We then need to add some imports at the top.

01:46.950 --> 01:51.870
We're going to get message and stan from node nets streaming.

01:53.410 --> 01:55.630
And I'll make sure that I also export that class.

01:57.130 --> 02:01.180
Now let's try to also extract this ticket created listener.

02:02.210 --> 02:06.950
So inside the events directory as well, I'll make a new file called Ticket Created Listener.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.320
I'm going to go and find the ticket created listener itself.

02:12.350 --> 02:13.220
I'm going to cut it.

02:14.540 --> 02:16.220
And then paste it into that new file.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.420
And then again, we do have to add in some imports at the top or listener.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.470
From Listener.

02:25.880 --> 02:31.190
And let's also get message from node nats streaming.

02:32.940 --> 02:35.130
I'll then make sure that I export the class itself.

02:38.590 --> 02:43.590
Now, finally back inside of the listener file, we have to make sure that we import ticket.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.950
Create a listener at the top.

02:45.940 --> 02:48.580
So I will import ticket created.

02:48.580 --> 02:53.890
Listener from events ticket created listener.

02:56.820 --> 03:00.510
I can then also clean up the imports up here for message and Stan.

03:01.670 --> 03:02.690
Schultz looks good.

03:04.010 --> 03:04.310
All right.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.670
If I go back over to my terminal, I should be able to confirm that everything is still working.

03:07.670 --> 03:08.870
Yep, it's still running.

03:08.870 --> 03:12.950
And if I publish an event, I see it appear in one of these terminal windows.

03:13.370 --> 03:14.000
Very good.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.350
So just a little bit of code.

03:15.350 --> 03:15.860
Clean up.

03:15.870 --> 03:16.640
Quick pause right here.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.810
Continue in just a minute.
