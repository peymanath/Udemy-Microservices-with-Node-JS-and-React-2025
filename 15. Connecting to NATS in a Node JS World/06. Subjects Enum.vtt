00:00.980 --> 00:05.360
In this video, we're going to start to add in several pieces of code to make sure that TypeScript can

00:05.360 --> 00:10.910
make sure that whenever we create a listener, we've got some matching subject and data type argument

00:10.910 --> 00:12.980
provided inside the on message function.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.730
So let's get to it.

00:14.750 --> 00:19.190
The first thing we're going to do inside of our events directory, we're going to create a new file.

00:19.190 --> 00:23.150
And inside there we're going to put together something that's going to list out all the different valid

00:23.150 --> 00:26.210
subject names that we ever expect to receive.

00:26.690 --> 00:31.430
So inside of my events directory, I'm going to make a new file called Simply Subjects.

00:32.810 --> 00:36.710
Now remember, a subject in the world of gnats is the name of a channel.

00:36.710 --> 00:41.180
So you can kind of think, think of this as being like an event name or something very similar to that.

00:42.030 --> 00:47.310
Inside this subject's file, we are going to export an enum called Subjects.

00:47.910 --> 00:52.620
And if you've never worked with an enum before, it's essentially somewhat similar to an object.

00:52.740 --> 00:57.570
We're going to list out a couple of properties inside of here, and we're going to then say if something

00:57.570 --> 01:02.430
is of type subjects, then that means that it is one of the different properties that is listed out

01:02.430 --> 01:03.030
inside.

01:03.060 --> 01:06.360
I'll show you an example of it right after we list out some different values inside of here.

01:06.780 --> 01:10.500
So inside of subjects, we're going to list all the possible subjects we expect to have.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.710
Well, we definitely expect to have a subject of ticket created.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.920
And we might eventually have one of say order updated as well.

01:17.940 --> 01:20.070
We definitely don't yet, but we might at the future.

01:20.100 --> 01:24.680
So just to give an example, we're going to add this in as a possible subject inside of the cam.

01:25.380 --> 01:28.200
So I'm going to say ticket created.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.720
Ticket it created.

01:31.460 --> 01:32.840
And then order.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.530
Was it updated?

01:33.530 --> 01:33.920
Yes.

01:33.920 --> 01:34.670
Order.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.180
Updated?

01:37.630 --> 01:39.880
Is order updated?

01:41.340 --> 01:43.890
And I'll put a comma after that first entry like so.

01:44.740 --> 01:50.740
So now just as a quick example of how we would use this enum, we could make a function called print

01:50.740 --> 01:51.610
subject.

01:52.420 --> 01:55.420
And we could say that in order to be an argument to this.

01:56.260 --> 02:01.870
We'll take in some argument called subject, and it must be one of the members or one of the properties

02:01.870 --> 02:05.710
or types options, whatever you want to call it, listed inside the column.

02:06.380 --> 02:10.430
So to call print subject, we cannot put in some random string.

02:10.430 --> 02:13.400
We must put in one of the different options from that enum.

02:13.670 --> 02:15.350
So to do so, we would write out.

02:16.200 --> 02:20.700
Subjects dot ticket created like so, and that works just fine.

02:20.970 --> 02:24.270
Or alternatively, we could do order updated as well.

02:25.590 --> 02:25.910
Okay.

02:25.920 --> 02:30.240
So as time goes on and we start to add in more possible events to our application, we're going to come

02:30.240 --> 02:33.270
back to the subject's file and list them out inside of here.

02:33.540 --> 02:37.290
This file alone is going to save us a ton of different typos.

02:37.290 --> 02:41.820
We're going to list out the actual event name or the actual subject that we're going to use with the

02:41.820 --> 02:44.370
nets as a hardcoded string inside of here.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.840
And then inside of all of our code, for example, inside of our listener that we just created, rather

02:48.840 --> 02:54.750
than referring to this hardcoded string right here, where we could very easily make a typo like say

02:54.750 --> 03:01.980
ticket created instead of the intended ticket colon created, we will instead refer to, say, subject's

03:02.340 --> 03:03.360
ticket created.

03:04.150 --> 03:08.020
And again, that's going to help us for making any very simple, straightforward typos.

03:08.290 --> 03:12.070
So this already is a good improvement, but we're not using it anywhere just yet.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.520
Let's take a quick pause right here.

03:13.540 --> 03:18.010
In the next video, we're going to start to come up with this structure that's going to allow TypeScript

03:18.010 --> 03:24.310
to understand that there is a tight coupling of sorts between a ticket subject or this ticket created

03:24.310 --> 03:28.030
subject and this event data type of ID title and price.
