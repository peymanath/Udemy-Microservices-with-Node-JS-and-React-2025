00:00.960 --> 00:04.710
As I mentioned in the last video, we're going to start to take a lot of the code inside of our Nats

00:04.710 --> 00:07.800
test project and merge it into the common module.

00:08.190 --> 00:13.110
We're then going to rebuild common, publish it and then update the tickets project and start to use

00:13.200 --> 00:14.400
that streaming server inside there.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.450
So let's get to it.

00:15.960 --> 00:20.850
Inside this Common Directory, I'll find CRC inside there I'll make a new folder called Events.

00:22.040 --> 00:27.350
Well, then find the events directory inside of Nat's test, and we're going to pull out the base listener.

00:28.090 --> 00:29.220
I'll do a multi select here.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.120
I'm also going to get the base publisher.

00:31.600 --> 00:32.890
I'm going to get subjects.

00:33.770 --> 00:36.680
I'm going to get the event definition and that's it.

00:37.190 --> 00:41.810
The listener and the publisher are things that are going to be ultimately defined and implemented inside

00:41.810 --> 00:48.170
of our individual services, because how a service listens to an incoming event like ticket created

00:48.170 --> 00:50.970
is going to be determined on a service by service basis.

00:50.990 --> 00:54.620
One service might want to take a ticket and do one thing with it.

00:54.620 --> 00:57.860
Another service might want to take a ticket and do another thing with it.

00:58.190 --> 01:00.230
So we're only taking the first four inside of here.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.850
So I'm going to copy all of this.

01:02.990 --> 01:07.430
I'll go up to the events directory we just created and paste those four files in.

01:10.180 --> 01:15.840
If we then go into that, say, base listener file, we're going to see right away that we get an error.

01:15.850 --> 01:17.890
So this is based listener inside of Common.

01:18.250 --> 01:21.700
We're getting an error because we have an import for node nat streaming.

01:22.000 --> 01:22.930
That's totally fine.

01:22.930 --> 01:25.630
We have not installed node net streaming into the common module.

01:25.630 --> 01:27.040
That's why we're seeing the error right now.

01:29.070 --> 01:33.780
I do want to immediately add in one or two more events that I know that we're going to need right away

01:33.780 --> 01:38.520
when we start to make use of this common module or the update to it back inside of our tickets service.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.390
So we've got an event here for ticket created.

01:41.400 --> 01:45.450
We're definitely going to need a event for a ticket update as well.

01:45.450 --> 01:47.970
So let's put together a event to describe that to.

01:49.030 --> 01:51.850
To do so we're going to first open up our subject's file.

01:52.770 --> 01:56.550
We're going to add in a new type to this thing of ticket updated.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.550
And I'll use a subject name of ticket colon updated.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.390
Now we are not actually using order updated, so I am going to delete that one just so we don't get

02:07.390 --> 02:13.450
confused on what we have and haven't implemented, it's now I only have to get created and to get updated.

02:14.110 --> 02:15.850
I'll then save this file and close it.

02:17.410 --> 02:24.370
Then also inside of events are going to make a new file called Ticket Updated Event Dates.

02:26.470 --> 02:28.150
Inside of ticket updated.

02:28.180 --> 02:32.260
We're going to write out some code that looks very similar to what we just did inside of ticket created.

02:33.740 --> 02:36.950
So inside of updated at the very top we will import.

02:38.070 --> 02:40.410
Subjects from subjects.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.220
Well, then export.

02:44.600 --> 02:48.170
An interface called Ticket Updated Event.

02:49.510 --> 02:53.380
We'll say that this thing is going to have a subject of subjects ticket updated.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.460
And we'll have some data as well.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.840
Now, we've been kind of just assuming that these tickets and the data around them was going to be just

03:00.840 --> 03:02.300
the ID title and price.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.110
I think that still stands for right now.

03:04.110 --> 03:08.550
Until we realize that we need some extra information, I think we'll just stick with saying we're going

03:08.550 --> 03:11.730
to emit information about the ID title and price of the ticket.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.400
So if we emit an update event, well, we probably want to include the updated information about this

03:17.400 --> 03:17.760
ticket.

03:17.760 --> 03:24.630
So once again, just ID of string, title of string and price of number.

03:26.820 --> 03:31.800
There is one other property that we might want to immediately add in, however, back inside of our

03:31.800 --> 03:32.880
tickets project.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.610
If we open up that model directory and take a look at our definition of what a ticket is, you might

03:37.610 --> 03:40.970
recall that a ticket also has a user ID property.

03:41.390 --> 03:45.740
We might want to add that in to these two event definitions right away, because there might eventually

03:45.740 --> 03:49.040
be some service that cares about who owns a ticket in particular.

03:49.680 --> 03:54.720
So let's add that into the event definition or ticket updated and ticket created in both them.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.780
I'm going to add in a user ID that is a string.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.670
So there it is inside of updated.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.330
I'll then go over to created.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.180
Add in user ID.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.620
That is a string as well.

04:07.560 --> 04:08.370
So looks good.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.500
Now, one other comment I want to throw out there.

04:11.920 --> 04:16.570
Inside this common module, we basically have everything just mixed up inside of this events directory.

04:16.870 --> 04:19.090
So we've got the base listener, base publisher.

04:19.090 --> 04:22.810
We got our listing of subjects, and then eventually we will have a lot of different files inside of

04:22.810 --> 04:25.360
here as well to describe all the different kinds of events.

04:25.510 --> 04:29.920
If you want to come up with a different structure for this directory, definitely go for it.

04:30.100 --> 04:34.990
I think that it doesn't make a lot of sense to mix all these folders or all these files together, especially

04:34.990 --> 04:37.900
since we're going to eventually have several others in here as well.

04:37.930 --> 04:41.970
So if you could think of a better way of organizing this directory, certainly feel free to do so.

04:41.980 --> 04:46.630
Just remember, whenever we do an import statement, you will have to adjust some paths if you start

04:46.630 --> 04:49.480
to nest these files inside of some other folders.

04:50.730 --> 04:56.310
All right, so before we do a republish of our common module, let's remember we have to go into our

04:56.310 --> 05:05.070
index file at the root CRC folder and we have to export the contents of all these events files so we

05:05.070 --> 05:07.950
can easily import them into other services.

05:09.440 --> 05:16.490
So inside of here we'll do an export star from events space listener.

05:17.270 --> 05:19.970
And then just going to copy paste that down a couple of times.

05:20.910 --> 05:22.410
I think five ought to do it.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.620
The next one will be bass publisher.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.400
Then subjects.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.690
Ticket created event.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.390
And ticket updated event.

05:36.550 --> 05:37.600
And that should be it.

05:38.420 --> 05:40.860
So now last step, we're going to go back over to our terminal.

05:41.770 --> 05:45.670
We're going to install Node Nat streaming into our common module.

05:46.480 --> 05:51.550
We're then going to republish this module and then update for right now just our ticket service.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.320
So I'm going to go back to my terminal.

05:54.350 --> 05:57.770
I'm going to close down everything that I'm running around this nets test stuff.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.900
I'm also going to stop the port forwarding stuff.

06:03.980 --> 06:07.400
And then going to change over to our common directory.

06:07.970 --> 06:10.400
I'm going to install Node.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.890
Now it's streaming.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.190
And then finally I'm going to do an end run pub.

06:20.650 --> 06:21.880
That was what our script was, right?

06:21.880 --> 06:23.110
It was just simply pub.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.870
Let's take a look inside of common module.

06:25.900 --> 06:26.130
Yep.

06:26.130 --> 06:26.970
It was just pub.

06:27.430 --> 06:33.690
So we'll do npm run pub that will do the commit the build the version, delete the build.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.210
Do the publish all that stuff.

06:36.210 --> 06:39.240
And it looks like I'm now on version 1013.

06:39.480 --> 06:43.830
So now we'll go backward to our ticket service also inside of our terminal, and we'll do that update.

06:45.180 --> 06:51.060
So I'll go back over to your tickets and NPM run or NPM updates.

06:51.060 --> 06:51.750
That's better.

06:52.390 --> 06:54.180
SG tickets comin.

06:55.250 --> 07:00.140
Now I'm going to expect to see some update message saying that this thing has been updated to 1.013.

07:00.140 --> 07:03.200
For me in particular, your version is probably different at this point.

07:03.230 --> 07:03.530
Yep.

07:03.530 --> 07:04.160
There we go.

07:04.190 --> 07:04.880
All set?

07:06.530 --> 07:07.160
All right.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.890
Well, we are pretty much done for right now.

07:09.890 --> 07:14.210
Anyways, with this common module, we now have our listing of events inside there.

07:14.210 --> 07:18.140
And as I mentioned, over time, we're going to come back to this thing and add in some other types

07:18.140 --> 07:18.920
of events.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.540
So let's take a pause right here.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.990
When we come back, the next video, we're going to go back to working on our ticket service.

07:23.990 --> 07:29.480
We'll make sure that any time someone creates a new ticket or any time someone updates the ticket,

07:29.690 --> 07:32.930
we will publish an event saying, hey, ticket updated.

07:33.260 --> 07:35.510
So a quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
