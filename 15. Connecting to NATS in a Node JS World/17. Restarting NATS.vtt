00:01.070 --> 00:03.680
We're going to start working on our ticket service again very shortly.

00:03.680 --> 00:05.810
But before we do, just a quick reminder.

00:06.170 --> 00:11.810
If we go back over to our terminal right now and do a little get pods, we will see that we've got our

00:11.810 --> 00:14.480
Nats deployment or the Nats pod running right there.

00:14.660 --> 00:20.270
And we've been running a lot of test code and we've been emitting a ton of events over to that Nats

00:20.270 --> 00:23.930
deployment that probably have a lot of trash data inside them.

00:24.260 --> 00:29.900
So we had a ton of events like for me, I think I had at least 90 all concerned with that ticket update

00:29.900 --> 00:32.330
event or the ticket create event, whichever it was.

00:32.660 --> 00:36.250
And chances are we might have been emitting some data that wasn't really valid.

00:36.260 --> 00:41.960
I know for certain we had an ID inside that ticket create event of like 1 to 3 and that is definitely

00:41.960 --> 00:43.310
not a valid ticket ID.

00:43.460 --> 00:48.620
So it might make a lot of sense for us to restart this Nats pod right here, which will cause all the

00:48.860 --> 00:51.470
events that we have already emitted to be dumped.

00:51.740 --> 00:55.430
Remember that Nats by default stores all these events in memory.

00:55.760 --> 01:00.410
So if we just restart the thing, all the events we've emitted so far get completely dumped and we won't

01:00.410 --> 01:04.340
have to worry about consuming those kind of non valid events.

01:04.340 --> 01:09.830
Once we start to handle incoming ticket created events for once we create a real publisher inside of

01:09.830 --> 01:10.940
one of our services.

01:11.090 --> 01:14.750
Long story short, let's just restart that thing so I can find a listing.

01:15.740 --> 01:18.530
I'm going to copy the name and I'll do a little.

01:20.010 --> 01:22.200
Delete pod and then put in the name.

01:23.420 --> 01:24.530
That's going to delete the pod.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.690
The deployment is going to automatically detect that the pod has been deleted and start up a new version.

01:29.930 --> 01:31.410
So if I do another get pods.

01:31.490 --> 01:32.140
There we go.

01:32.150 --> 01:33.260
There's a brand new pod.

01:33.860 --> 01:37.640
So because we restart the pod nets was clearly restarted.

01:38.350 --> 01:41.590
We don't have any of the events that we have previously had emitted.

01:41.590 --> 01:45.070
And so if we start to connect with some new service or something like that, we're not going to get

01:45.070 --> 01:49.750
a bunch of trash data along that subject or that channel of ticket colon created.

01:50.380 --> 01:54.910
Now, of course, moving forward in the course, at any point in time, if you are feeling like your

01:54.910 --> 01:59.290
Nats deployment has a ton of trash data inside of it, you just will repeat these same steps.

01:59.290 --> 02:04.480
You'll do a delete pod, then just verify that a new one was created by the deployment.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.100
So that's good.

02:07.300 --> 02:08.160
Another quick pause.

02:08.170 --> 02:09.760
Work on tickets in just a moment.
