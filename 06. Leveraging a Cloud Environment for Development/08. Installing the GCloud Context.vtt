00:00.640 --> 00:05.080
Now that the Google Cloud SDK is all installed and configured, we're going to tell it to go and fetch

00:05.080 --> 00:09.280
some context information to connect to the cluster we just created in Google Cloud.

00:09.610 --> 00:14.170
Now, how we do this really comes down to a little decision that you need to make on your end.

00:14.650 --> 00:19.190
At this point in time, we still have Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows running up here.

00:19.210 --> 00:23.830
So if I click on that little icon, yep, Docker is running and Kubernetes is running.

00:24.340 --> 00:29.500
If you do not want to run Docker on your local machine at all anymore, then you're going to run the

00:29.500 --> 00:31.990
two commands you see over here to the left hand side.

00:32.680 --> 00:37.660
First off, you're going to close Docker desktop, so you'll go up there and hit Docker Desktop.

00:37.990 --> 00:44.830
You'll then run Google Cloud or G Cloud components, install cube ETL that will grab a custom version

00:44.830 --> 00:50.500
or really not a custom version, but it will grab cube ETL and install it on your local machine.

00:51.790 --> 00:56.470
Because of that, you no longer have to be running this Docker client and you can even uninstall that

00:56.470 --> 00:57.760
local Docker client.

00:58.610 --> 01:01.070
You'll then run g cloud container clusters.

01:01.100 --> 01:01.820
Get credentials.

01:01.820 --> 01:07.490
And then whatever your cluster name is, your cluster name is going to be back over on your dashboard.

01:07.520 --> 01:12.000
It'll be whatever name we entered in right there, which in this case is ticketing dash dev.

01:13.600 --> 01:18.190
So if you go through this process, you no longer need Docker for desktop on your local machine.

01:18.580 --> 01:23.620
If you're still running Docker or you still want to have this Docker client around, then you will instead

01:23.620 --> 01:26.290
run G cloud container clusters, blah blah blah.

01:27.040 --> 01:31.030
Chances are you're going to fit in this crew or this side over here.

01:31.180 --> 01:36.220
The only reason to go with these stuff on the left hand side is if you really, truly are very sure

01:36.220 --> 01:41.080
that you're not going to be running Docker locally anytime soon, or if you have space constraints on

01:41.080 --> 01:43.030
your local machine or something like that.

01:43.540 --> 01:47.380
So again, chances are you're going to be using this command over here on the right hand side.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.420
As a matter of fact, that's what I'm going to do as well.

01:50.810 --> 01:59.690
So I'm going to go back over to my terminal and I will run g cloud container clusters, get dash credentials,

01:59.690 --> 02:05.210
and then the name of my cluster, which as we just saw a moment ago, is ticketing dash dev.

02:09.760 --> 02:10.780
So I'll run that.

02:11.580 --> 02:15.090
And then very quickly it'll pretty much resolve and kick me back to the command line.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.040
So did it work?

02:17.220 --> 02:18.310
Well, that's a good question.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.580
I'm going to go back up here to the top right hand side.

02:21.480 --> 02:26.430
Or find my little Docker for desktop icon, then go down to Kubernetes and you'll notice I now have

02:26.430 --> 02:28.800
an additional entry in this little context menu.

02:29.400 --> 02:35.190
So this little entry right here is how I'm going to tell Kube CTL that I want to connect to the Kubernetes

02:35.190 --> 02:37.860
cluster that is running in Google Cloud.

02:38.100 --> 02:43.230
If I ever want to use my local cluster instead, I can select Docker Desktop instead.

02:43.410 --> 02:45.120
So let me show you this in action.

02:45.300 --> 02:49.410
I'm going to select Docker Desktop and then at my terminal I'll do a queue.

02:49.560 --> 02:56.070
It'll get pods and when I do so, you'll see that without a doubt I'm connected to my local cluster.

02:56.250 --> 03:02.040
My local cluster has the auth pod running, which we created that deployment for just a little bit ago.

03:02.610 --> 03:09.210
If I then go back up to this dropdown and select the other context, I am now connected through CTL

03:09.240 --> 03:12.030
to the cluster that we just created in Google Cloud.

03:12.210 --> 03:15.120
So I can now do a cube, CTL, get pods.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.620
And you'll see that says no resources found.

03:18.650 --> 03:23.690
That's because the cluster we just made in the cloud is, of course, running nothing whatsoever.

03:25.500 --> 03:29.520
So we can now toggle between these two different clusters very easily if we need to.

03:29.850 --> 03:34.230
Now, having said that, moving forward in the course really encourage you to keep your mind on this

03:34.230 --> 03:38.550
little menu right here and make sure that you are always connected to the appropriate cluster.

03:38.910 --> 03:43.200
So for right now, because I'm still going to show you how to finish up this initial setup of the cluster

03:43.200 --> 03:44.010
in Google Cloud.

03:44.010 --> 03:45.780
I'm going to leave it on that context.

03:45.780 --> 03:50.070
But eventually, later on after we go through this Google Cloud setup, I'm going to eventually go back

03:50.070 --> 03:51.240
to my local cluster.

03:51.240 --> 03:56.100
And so at some point in time, I'm going to go here and go back to Docker Desktop instead.

03:57.020 --> 03:57.290
Okay.

03:57.290 --> 04:00.020
So this is looking pretty good, but we're not quite done yet.

04:00.170 --> 04:05.390
Even though we have connected to this cluster that's running the cloud, we still do not have the ability

04:05.390 --> 04:08.660
to tell scaffold to build any of our images.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.560
Using this Google Cloud build thing.

04:11.740 --> 04:13.600
So we saw it a little bit of set up to do.

04:13.630 --> 04:17.110
Let's take a pause right here and then finish this stuff up in the next video.
