In the last video, we made an update to our scaffold HTML file.

00:03.950 --> 00:07.370
There's actually two other small things we need to update inside of here very quickly.

00:07.790 --> 00:13.370
First off, we currently have a option right here of local and an option of Google Cloud built.

00:13.580 --> 00:18.320
We can actually only have one of these options present inside of our scaffold file at any time.

00:18.500 --> 00:22.640
So I'm going to find the section that says Local push false and comment it out.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.470
I'll then save this file.

00:25.400 --> 00:30.540
Next up, we're going to find our people file inside of that deployment file.

00:30.560 --> 00:35.420
We had listed out the image to use with all the different pods that were being managed by this deployment.

00:35.870 --> 00:40.850
The image that's being listed right here is still referring to our old image, the one with the name

00:40.850 --> 00:42.800
of your Docker ID slash off.

00:43.040 --> 00:47.480
But inside of our scaffold file we are saying that the image is going to have a very different name.

00:47.690 --> 00:52.430
So we need to make sure that we update that deployment and tell it to use this image name instead.

00:52.820 --> 00:59.180
So I'm going to copy that image name over to my off deployment file and update the image name right

00:59.180 --> 00:59.720
there.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.710
Like so.

01:01.440 --> 01:01.670
Okay.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.410
That's better now that we've got those two fixes in place.

01:04.410 --> 01:06.240
Let's continue in the next video.
