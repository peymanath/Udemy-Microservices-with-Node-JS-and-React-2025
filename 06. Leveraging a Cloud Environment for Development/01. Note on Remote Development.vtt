00:01.370 --> 00:05.270
We can now access our application inside the browser, which is fantastic.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.780
Before we move on and continue developing this server any more.

00:08.810 --> 00:10.940
There's something very quick I want to mention.

00:11.480 --> 00:16.220
This video and the series of videos right after it are a part of an optional section.

00:16.400 --> 00:21.320
So in this very optional section, which you do not have to watch, we are going to learn how to set

00:21.320 --> 00:24.170
up our development environment to run through Google Cloud.

00:24.410 --> 00:29.060
The reason that we are going to do this is that later on, as we continue with this application, we're

00:29.060 --> 00:32.060
going to have many different pods running inside of our local cluster.

00:32.210 --> 00:37.580
If you're on an older computer, you might eventually start to experience a lot of lag or even crashes

00:37.580 --> 00:40.130
because of the amount of code that we are executing.

00:40.400 --> 00:47.360
So if you're on an older machine specifically or particularly if you are on a older Windows machine,

00:47.360 --> 00:51.890
as you continue building this application, you might eventually start to experience some crashes.

00:52.130 --> 00:56.690
And so in this optional section, I'm going to show you how you can get around that by running all of

00:56.690 --> 01:00.260
our code on Google Cloud instead of on your local machine.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.090
Now, something very important.

01:02.090 --> 01:05.420
This does not have to be done right now this instant.

01:05.450 --> 01:09.860
The reason I'm putting this videos right here is because if you are on an older machine, I just cannot

01:09.860 --> 01:12.370
predict when you're going to start to experience some crashes.

01:12.380 --> 01:16.380
It might be after we create three pods or it might be after we create ten.

01:16.400 --> 01:20.630
So I'm just going to show you right now how to set up all this stuff to run through Google Cloud.

01:20.630 --> 01:25.220
And if you are going to anticipate going through this stuff or having the performance issues rate,

01:25.220 --> 01:26.250
do the setup right now.

01:26.270 --> 01:28.580
Otherwise, just continue on with the course.

01:28.580 --> 01:31.940
And if you start to experience performance issues, then go ahead and do the setup.

01:31.940 --> 01:33.290
Then it's totally up to you.

01:34.010 --> 01:39.460
Now, having said that, another quick note here to make use of Google Cloud as our development environment,

01:39.470 --> 01:41.480
you must have a credit card.

01:41.510 --> 01:42.650
This is strictly required.

01:42.660 --> 01:43.990
There's nothing I can do about it.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.590
You have to have a credit card.

01:46.190 --> 01:51.110
Now, you probably are not going to have to pay any money because we're going to use a relatively small

01:51.110 --> 01:53.120
amount of resources on Google Cloud.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.070
So we should be fitting into the free tier.

01:55.070 --> 01:59.840
You should not be getting charged any money, but that is not at all a guarantee.

01:59.840 --> 02:04.280
I am not guaranteeing you that you're not going to have to pay money, but we should not have to.

02:05.190 --> 02:10.140
At present, when you create a new Google Cloud account, specifically make a new account, you get

02:10.140 --> 02:13.080
$300 in credit once you associate a credit card.

02:13.080 --> 02:17.850
And there's no way that we're ever going to be spending more than $300 unless you do something very,

02:17.850 --> 02:18.800
very wrong.

02:18.810 --> 02:21.230
So, again, we should be fitting into this free tier.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.900
You should not have to pay any actual money, but it will require a credit card.

02:24.900 --> 02:29.550
And I'm not necessarily guaranteeing that you're not going to be charged if you do something wrong during

02:29.550 --> 02:30.570
the setup process.

02:31.210 --> 02:31.530
Okay.

02:31.530 --> 02:35.970
So now that we understand the purpose of the following videos, if you're on a very new computer, if

02:35.970 --> 02:39.690
you don't think that you're going to run into any performance issues or if you just don't have a credit

02:39.690 --> 02:41.190
card to use, no problem.

02:41.190 --> 02:46.190
Skip over the next set of videos that are talking about Google Cloud and continue with the setup stuff.

02:46.200 --> 02:50.220
Otherwise, continue in the next video and I'm going to show you how to use Google Cloud.
