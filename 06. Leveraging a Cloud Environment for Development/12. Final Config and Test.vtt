WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:01.680
All right, so this is it.

00:01.690 --> 00:03.010
This is the moment of truth.

00:03.040 --> 00:06.640
We're going to restart scaffold at our terminal as soon as we do so.

00:06.640 --> 00:11.380
Scaffold should attempt to build this image that we listed inside of our scaffold config file using

00:11.380 --> 00:12.610
Google Cloud built.

00:12.910 --> 00:18.820
It will then take our off deployment and the ingress service config and apply them to our remote cluster.

00:18.820 --> 00:20.890
So let's get to it first.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.270
I'm going to go back over to my terminal.

00:22.300 --> 00:26.350
I'm going to make sure that I shut down any previous version of Scaffold that might still be running.

00:26.890 --> 00:31.780
I'll then go to my Kubernetes or Docker window and just make sure I've got the correct context still

00:31.780 --> 00:32.500
selected.

00:33.350 --> 00:38.900
And then after that, I'll do a scaffold dev inside of my root project directory.

00:40.950 --> 00:44.760
So as soon as I do so, scaffold is going to attempt to build our image remotely.

00:45.180 --> 00:48.050
It's going to try to build it using Google Cloud build.

00:48.060 --> 00:52.800
So again, as a reminder, all that building stuff is occurring using Google Cloud built.

00:53.100 --> 00:57.960
We should actually be able to see the image build in process if we hop over to the Google Cloud Build

00:57.960 --> 00:59.400
dashboard really quickly.

01:00.030 --> 01:04.270
So if I go back over to a Google Cloud, find the menu on the top left hand side.

01:04.290 --> 01:08.520
I can then scroll way down this menu to the tools section.

01:09.550 --> 01:12.310
So here's tools right here and you'll see cloud build.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.200
I'll then select history.

01:15.290 --> 01:17.570
And I'll see my build listed right on here.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.590
If I click on the build itself, you'll see a lot of output from the build process.

01:23.470 --> 01:27.730
Just about all the output you see right here probably looks identical to the details from when we were

01:27.730 --> 01:29.230
building these images locally.

01:29.470 --> 01:33.580
So we'll see stuff inside of here, like setting up that working directory, copying over the package

01:33.760 --> 01:36.640
JSON file, doing the NPM install and so on.

01:37.480 --> 01:43.750
Eventually the image gets built and then it's pushed off to our repository of images on Google Cloud.

01:43.870 --> 01:48.700
So all these images are now being pushed to a Google Cloud repository of images.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.610
No longer are we making use of Docker hub.

01:53.170 --> 02:00.340
After this image is built, scaffold is then going to attempt to create our deployment, the service

02:00.340 --> 02:04.900
and apply our ingress rules to this cluster on Google Cloud.

02:04.960 --> 02:09.250
So you'll see that the deployment inside of our logs over here was created, there's the service created

02:09.250 --> 02:11.350
and the ingress was created as well.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.840
And then eventually we get our console.log.

02:14.640 --> 02:20.700
So this logging information right here is coming out of our pod, running on a remote virtual machine

02:20.700 --> 02:22.180
on Google Cloud.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.630
None of the stuff is running locally anymore.

02:24.660 --> 02:28.020
And I don't know about you, but that is pretty awesome.

02:28.380 --> 02:29.100
Pretty cool.

02:29.800 --> 02:34.700
So now in theory, as we start to add in more pods, more deployments, more everything into our cluster.

02:34.730 --> 02:39.200
We're not going to start slowing down our local machine anymore because all that stuff is going to be

02:39.200 --> 02:43.040
created on some local or excuse me, some remote machine.

02:44.570 --> 02:47.930
Now last thing we need to do is actually test this stuff out in the browser and see if we could still

02:47.930 --> 02:48.740
connect.

02:49.160 --> 02:53.930
So I'm going to once again try to visit our URL or our domain that we had set up inside of our host

02:53.930 --> 02:59.000
file and going to try to get at our users current user route again.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.430
So API users, current user.

03:02.180 --> 03:03.770
That's the route that should retrieve.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.610
Hi there.

03:04.970 --> 03:09.050
So I'm going to just take that URL paste inside of a new tab.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.490
I'm going to see that same kind of.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.500
Your connection is not private again.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.110
So again, we're just going to ignore this for right now.

03:15.110 --> 03:18.740
This is related to some nasty setup inside of ingress engine x.

03:19.580 --> 03:22.400
If you go to advanced once again, we cannot seem to get around this.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.690
So we're going to use that kind of little workaround command that we spoke about a little bit ago.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.220
You just type into that window.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.790
This is unsafe because again, we know what we're doing.

03:32.210 --> 03:35.210
Rome really isn't happy what we're doing, what we're doing here.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.260
We'll eventually fix this.

03:36.260 --> 03:37.940
But right now, let's just get around it.

03:37.940 --> 03:38.720
So I will type in.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.340
This is unsafe.

03:41.370 --> 03:42.040
And there we go.

03:42.060 --> 03:42.580
I've got high.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.890
They're appearing on the screen.

03:46.070 --> 03:47.870
All right, so this looks awesome.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.590
Well, we've got everything built.

03:50.620 --> 03:55.870
The last thing I want to mention here is that moving forward in the course, I am probably not going

03:55.870 --> 03:58.780
to be running all this stuff on the remote cluster.

03:58.810 --> 04:02.500
Again, this is for people out there who are watching this course who might have a little bit of an

04:02.500 --> 04:03.610
older machine.

04:04.490 --> 04:08.600
The reason this is relevant is that in a little bit or in the coming videos, you're going to see that

04:08.600 --> 04:12.860
my scaffold HTML file will revert back to its previous look.

04:13.070 --> 04:18.530
So in coming videos you are going to see that I do not have a Google Cloud build in there.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.540
You're going to see that I've got local push set to false.

04:21.560 --> 04:26.450
You're going to see that I have an image of Steven Grider auth and so on.

04:26.930 --> 04:30.200
So in the coming videos, it's really important for you.

04:30.230 --> 04:36.050
This is up to you to make sure that any time we come into the scaffold HTML file, you put the appropriate

04:36.050 --> 04:37.550
image name in here.

04:37.760 --> 04:45.380
So the image name that you should be using is us, GCR IO, then your project ID and then the name of

04:45.380 --> 04:47.450
the directory or the image that we are building.

04:47.450 --> 04:48.860
So in this case, simply off.

04:49.370 --> 04:54.680
So at some point in time in the future, we are going to build an image called orders or an order service.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.280
When we do.

04:55.280 --> 05:03.500
So you are going to add inside of here this block, but it will be orders right there and orders right

05:03.500 --> 05:04.260
there instead.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.130
So again, that is up to you.

05:06.140 --> 05:10.190
I may or may not recall or remember to tell you in the relevant videos to do that.

05:12.780 --> 05:17.270
The other thing I want you to remember is that when we start to put together some other deployment files,

05:17.280 --> 05:21.780
so if we put together, say, in orders deployment file, you will need to enter in the appropriate

05:21.780 --> 05:23.320
image name right there as well.

05:23.340 --> 05:28.410
So you need to enter in us GCR, blah, blah, blah, because what I'm going to be writing in is something

05:28.410 --> 05:31.320
like that because I'm going to be running the stuff on my local machine.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.370
So again, I can't say it.

05:32.370 --> 05:36.960
Enough is up to you to remember to make these changes because I know that some people out there are

05:36.960 --> 05:39.450
going to unfortunately, maybe not quite remember.

05:39.450 --> 05:41.370
So again, please just keep that in mind.

05:41.970 --> 05:42.420
All right.

05:42.420 --> 05:44.220
Well, it looks like all this stuff is working.

05:44.400 --> 05:48.840
Now, last thing I want to remind you is that at this point in time, you are now paying in theory,

05:48.840 --> 05:54.270
you might be chewing through some free credits, but you are in theory, paying for this running cluster.

05:54.270 --> 05:59.400
So if at some point in time you decide to stop taking this course for any reason, or if you say, hey,

05:59.400 --> 06:04.560
I'm going to come back to this in like a month or two, then you need to open up the cluster on Google

06:04.560 --> 06:08.880
Cloud and click on Delete right there and just delete this thing entirely.

06:08.880 --> 06:12.660
Because as long as this thing is running again, you are paying money for it.

06:12.660 --> 06:15.420
So don't forget to hop on here and delete the cluster.

06:17.140 --> 06:18.410
Well, that is pretty much it.

06:18.430 --> 06:21.370
So now that all this stuff is set up, let's take a quick pause right here.

06:21.370 --> 06:25.240
And we're going to continue building our actual application in the next video.
