00:00.760 --> 00:03.160
We are almost done with this remote cluster setup.

00:03.160 --> 00:05.770
We just have to go through a handful of additional steps.

00:05.770 --> 00:09.430
So I listed the steps out right here just so it's really clear exactly what we have to do.

00:10.710 --> 00:15.060
As a quick reminder, we're going to use Google Cloud Built to build all of our images from now on.

00:15.300 --> 00:19.290
So we spoke about that when we were taking a look at this diagram right here.

00:19.680 --> 00:23.940
So Google Cloud Build is going to be in charge of building all of our images using our source code in

00:23.940 --> 00:25.250
their accompanying Docker file.

00:25.260 --> 00:29.640
And again, the reason we are doing this is because Google Cloud Build can generally build these images

00:29.640 --> 00:34.470
more quickly than we can on our local machine, particularly as we get on to some stuff later on where

00:34.470 --> 00:37.300
we're going to be downloading some rather large dependencies.

00:37.340 --> 00:39.000
You'll see why when we get to that point.

00:40.490 --> 00:45.890
After that, we're going to update our scaffold YAML file to tell it to use Google Cloud Build.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.660
That's going to be a very, very easy update.

00:47.660 --> 00:48.020
Don't worry.

00:48.020 --> 00:49.190
That's not challenging at all.

00:50.180 --> 00:55.100
After that, we're going to make sure that we set up Ingress Engine X on our Google Cloud Cluster.

00:55.100 --> 01:00.560
So we set up Ingress Engine X on our local cluster, but none of that configuration carries over to

01:00.560 --> 01:02.120
the cluster that we just created.

01:02.150 --> 01:07.310
We have to go through those same initialization commands that we ran a while ago on our local machine.

01:08.940 --> 01:14.130
After that, we're going to update our host file again yet again, because we need to make sure that

01:14.130 --> 01:17.970
whenever we go to ticketing dev, we no longer go to our local machine.

01:17.970 --> 01:22.050
Instead, we want to go to the IP address that's been assigned to our remote cluster.

01:22.290 --> 01:26.700
And then finally we will go ahead and restart scaffold and we'll start to build all these images and

01:26.700 --> 01:27.660
all that kind of stuff.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.870
So let's go through the step by step.

01:30.140 --> 01:32.600
We're going to first enable Google Cloud build.

01:32.870 --> 01:37.820
So back at my Google Cloud console, I'm going to go to the menu once again on the top left.

01:38.120 --> 01:42.920
I'll then scroll down a pretty good bit until I find tools right here.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.470
A click on Cloud Built.

01:46.420 --> 01:48.130
And then we'll click on Enable.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.780
And that should be it.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.400
Now, this might take a couple of seconds, so we'll just go ahead and let it do its thing while that

01:56.400 --> 01:57.090
is running.

01:57.180 --> 02:01.850
Let's go back over to our code editor where we are going to update our scaffolding HTML file.

02:01.860 --> 02:05.160
And again, we're going to tell it that we want it to use Google Cloud built.

02:06.130 --> 02:07.630
So I'm going to open up my editor.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.080
I've already got my scaffold file open right here.

02:12.230 --> 02:14.690
We're going to make just two small changes inside of here.

02:15.080 --> 02:19.880
So first off, I'm going to find where we specify the build section and then right after where it says

02:19.880 --> 02:21.200
local push false.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.610
I'm going to add in a new section that says Google Cloud Build.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.190
I'll then specify a project ID.

02:29.640 --> 02:32.640
Notice that the DH in ID is lowercase.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.550
And then we're going to enter our project ID right there.

02:35.910 --> 02:40.860
Now, remember, our actual project ID is not exactly what it says at the top left hand side, it is

02:40.860 --> 02:42.000
not ticketing diff.

02:42.300 --> 02:47.460
Instead, we probably got assigned to you probably as well, got assigned an ID randomly and that's

02:47.460 --> 02:49.380
what you see over here on the right hand column.

02:49.860 --> 02:52.380
So I'm going to take that ID, copy it.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.570
And then paste it over at Project ID.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.210
Then after that, we're also going to update the image.

03:02.340 --> 03:03.240
Right there.

03:03.810 --> 03:06.540
So we kind of randomly decided on that name.

03:06.540 --> 03:08.520
The first part of the image name makes a lot of sense.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.450
It's our Docker ID.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.910
But the second part is again, more or less random.

03:13.060 --> 03:17.440
When we pass this building process off to Google Cloud built.

03:18.310 --> 03:22.300
So the thing that we were just at this thing right here, it looks like the API has now been enabled.

03:22.330 --> 03:27.100
Google Cloud Build is going to essentially more or less assign a somewhat random name.

03:27.100 --> 03:28.000
Let's not really random.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.700
It is a structured name to the images that it builds.

03:30.910 --> 03:35.500
So we need to specify the image name that Google Cloud is going to assign to our image when it gets

03:35.500 --> 03:36.040
built.

03:36.700 --> 03:42.250
The formats that Google Cloud uses to decide what to call your image is always the exact same format.

03:42.250 --> 03:50.620
It is always going to be us dot gcr, dot io slash then the name of your project.

03:51.010 --> 03:55.330
So you're going to put the name of the project ID so you're going to put your project ID the same thing

03:55.330 --> 03:58.120
we just pasted in a moment ago right after that slash.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.930
And then after that we'll put in the name of our project directory.

04:02.930 --> 04:04.300
So in this case it's off.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.080
So I'll put in off over there.

04:08.660 --> 04:09.620
And that's it.

04:11.480 --> 04:11.590
Okay.

04:11.720 --> 04:12.950
So I'm going to save this file.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.170
And that's all we should have to change inside of our scaffold e-mail file.

04:18.340 --> 04:22.030
I'm then going to go back over to my diagram really quickly.

04:22.360 --> 04:25.570
So we just achieved step one and step two right there.

04:25.810 --> 04:30.180
So let's take another brief pause and we'll make sure that we do that initial setup of Ingress Engine

04:30.190 --> 04:34.000
X on our Google Cloud cluster again in the next video.
