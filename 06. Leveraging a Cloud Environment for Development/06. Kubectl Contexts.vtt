00:01.530 --> 00:04.980
It looks like my Kubernetes cluster right here is still being created, but there's a little bit of

00:04.980 --> 00:05.790
setup that we can do.

00:05.790 --> 00:10.530
In the meantime, I want to give you a quick reminder that right now, if we open up our terminal,

00:10.710 --> 00:13.260
we can run cubes, it'll get pods.

00:13.260 --> 00:17.850
And when we do so, we're going to see some information about the cluster on our local machine.

00:18.300 --> 00:19.860
So now here's something interesting.

00:19.860 --> 00:23.640
How do we somehow connect to the cluster that we just created in Google Cloud?

00:23.970 --> 00:29.070
Well, to access different clusters, we're always going to end up using the same cube CTL command.

00:29.370 --> 00:33.480
Behind the scenes, there are some configuration options that are being applied to Cube CTL.

00:33.900 --> 00:38.700
When we change those configuration options, it's going to change which cluster we are connecting to.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.920
Let me show you a diagram just to help you understand.

00:41.820 --> 00:42.210
All right.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.920
So quick diagram right here.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.560
So on our local machine, we are currently running Cube CTL.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.980
Behind the scenes, Cube CTL uses something called context.

00:51.250 --> 00:55.120
Contacts can be thought of essentially as some different connection settings.

00:55.180 --> 01:01.780
They list out some authorization credentials, some users, some IP addresses, a lot of different information

01:01.780 --> 01:06.460
to tell Cube, CTL how to connect that to different clusters that exist in the world.

01:07.060 --> 01:12.400
Right now, we are connecting to our local cluster through a context that was created when we first

01:12.400 --> 01:15.700
installed Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac on your machine.

01:16.150 --> 01:20.920
As a matter of fact, if you go to your Docker icon right now and then mouse over Kubernetes, you'll

01:20.920 --> 01:22.900
see something that says context right there.

01:22.900 --> 01:25.570
And our current context is Docker Dash Desktop.

01:26.880 --> 01:32.070
So this context right here has some connection settings inside of it to tell us how to connect to our

01:32.070 --> 01:33.090
local cluster.

01:33.690 --> 01:39.960
We need to add in a second context, a new context that's going to tell CTL how to connect to the cluster

01:39.960 --> 01:41.850
that we just created in Google Cloud.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.800
There's two ways we can do this.

01:43.800 --> 01:50.010
We can either use the Google Cloud dashboard over here and go through a series of different menus to

01:50.010 --> 01:54.360
find some little config that we would copy paste into a file on our local machine.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.730
That would be one way to add the context.

01:56.910 --> 02:03.060
Another way that is a lot easier is to instead install a tool called the Google Cloud SDK.

02:03.300 --> 02:07.680
This is a command line tool that we can use to interface with Google Cloud automatically.

02:08.160 --> 02:13.560
The Google Cloud SDK does a ton of different things, but one thing that it does for us is create these

02:13.560 --> 02:19.920
different contexts for us automatically and update on our local machine and teach it how to connect

02:19.920 --> 02:22.530
to the clusters that we are creating in Google Cloud.

02:23.130 --> 02:28.620
So we are now going to install this Google Cloud SDK and it's going to automatically manage these context

02:28.620 --> 02:32.310
things for us to install the Google Cloud SDK.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.890
We're going to go to the address you see right here on the screen.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.890
Now, these URLs, of course, break every now and then.

02:37.890 --> 02:42.450
So if you try to go to this address and it doesn't work, all you have to do is do a quick Google search

02:42.450 --> 02:46.230
for Google Cloud SDK and you'll see a link come up for it right away.

02:47.550 --> 02:50.310
So I'm going to take that URL and visit it inside of a new tab.

02:51.090 --> 02:56.220
All then be prompted here with installation directions for a variety of different operating systems.

02:56.340 --> 03:00.000
So as you guess, just go ahead and select your appropriate operating system.

03:00.890 --> 03:03.140
And it will show you some installation directions.

03:03.680 --> 03:09.830
Now, in every case, there's going to be kind of a series of different installation paths in here.

03:10.130 --> 03:12.710
So you'll see one that says something like Before you begin.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.140
And those will be some steps to do initially.

03:15.440 --> 03:19.190
And then eventually it'll have something about initialize the SDK.

03:19.430 --> 03:21.800
You do not have to initialize the SDK just yet.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.110
You and I are going to do that together in the next video.

03:24.530 --> 03:30.020
So all you have to do is go through the process of installing the Sdhc and then going through any additional

03:30.020 --> 03:35.510
steps that it recommends, such as this optional one right here to get access to the cloud sdhc very

03:35.510 --> 03:36.710
easily through your terminal.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.190
Again, you do not want to run the g cloud init command.

03:40.190 --> 03:42.380
We're going to do that together in just a moment.

03:43.160 --> 03:43.430
All right.

03:43.430 --> 03:45.110
So go ahead and install this thing.

03:45.140 --> 03:48.770
We'll come back in the next video and we'll go to that initialization process together.
