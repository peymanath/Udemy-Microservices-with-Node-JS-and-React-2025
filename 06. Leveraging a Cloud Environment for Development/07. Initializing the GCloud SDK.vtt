00:01.110 --> 00:05.100
In the last video, we installed the Google Cloud SDK on our local machine.

00:05.100 --> 00:08.700
And remember, the entire reason we're doing this is to have it automatically manage these different

00:08.700 --> 00:13.680
contexts, things that are going to teach CTL how to connect to different clusters.

00:14.100 --> 00:20.490
So back at my command line, I should now be able to run G Cloud like so and see some help information

00:20.490 --> 00:21.090
appear.

00:21.210 --> 00:25.170
If you do not see any help information appear, that means there is something wrong with your installation

00:25.170 --> 00:27.120
and you'll need to do a little bit of troubleshooting.

00:28.550 --> 00:28.910
All right.

00:28.910 --> 00:34.490
So now that we've got Google Cloud installed, we're going to first log in to the Cloud SDK.

00:34.760 --> 00:38.360
So I'm going to type out G cloud off, log in.

00:41.290 --> 00:45.010
A little window will appear in attempt to log me into my Google account.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.690
You'll need to make sure that you log into the same exact Google account that you used when you first

00:49.690 --> 00:51.650
signed up for the Google Cloud platform.

00:51.670 --> 00:52.600
A moment to go.

00:53.230 --> 00:55.120
So for me that is my account listed right here.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.140
So go ahead and click on it after I click on that thing and allow.

00:59.880 --> 01:04.440
I'll then get redirected over to some other page like this right here.

01:04.890 --> 01:08.970
Once I see this page, I can now close it and then go back over to my terminal.

01:11.560 --> 01:16.990
So I'm now logged in to the G Cloud SDK, and now we're going to run another command that's going to

01:16.990 --> 01:22.060
initialize the Google Cloud SDK and tell it a little bit about our particular project that we're trying

01:22.060 --> 01:22.630
to run.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.120
I'm going to run G Cloud.

01:26.030 --> 01:31.790
In it now I have already initialized g-cloud once previously in the past, so I'm going to see some

01:31.790 --> 01:34.510
different output here than what you are probably going to see.

01:34.520 --> 01:40.070
So when I run it, I see some stuff that says, Hey, you've already got some configuration and I can

01:40.070 --> 01:42.980
either re initialize a configuration or create a new one.

01:43.070 --> 01:48.620
You might see something that immediately tries to take you through the process of creating a configuration.

01:49.230 --> 01:53.700
So if you see something that just says, okay, fantastic, let's create a new configuration, that's

01:53.700 --> 01:54.090
great.

01:54.090 --> 01:57.750
But for me, I'm going to go ahead and click re initialize this configuration.

02:00.780 --> 02:05.160
Once I do so, I'll then be prompted to select which account I want to use for the configuration.

02:05.160 --> 02:08.160
So I'm going to use the account that I just signed in with a moment to go.

02:10.390 --> 02:16.000
Now we'll be given a list of all the different projects that exist inside your Google Cloud account.

02:16.030 --> 02:20.260
I have a ton of different projects right now, so you'll see a huge list right here.

02:20.260 --> 02:23.590
But for you personally, you'll probably see a much smaller list.

02:23.620 --> 02:26.560
Unless you've already use this Google Cloud account in the past.

02:27.100 --> 02:30.100
You might not immediately see your project listed in here.

02:30.430 --> 02:35.050
That's because we have given our project a name of ticketing dash dev.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.670
But behind the scenes, Google Cloud has assigned this thing a random identifier.

02:39.670 --> 02:44.410
So to figure out exactly what your real project name is, you can click on that little project selector

02:44.410 --> 02:44.980
up there.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.750
Find your project in the list and then find the ID column on the right hand side.

02:49.900 --> 02:56.410
So you will see that my actual project ID is Pacific Destiny, blah blah blah, not ticketing dash dev.

02:57.440 --> 03:02.240
So I'm going to go back over to my project list right here, and I'm going to find specific destiny.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.510
And again, for you, it's very likely going to be something very different.

03:06.210 --> 03:07.020
So I will see.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.900
My project ID is right there.

03:08.910 --> 03:10.530
It's number 17.

03:11.740 --> 03:15.290
So we are being prompted to enter in the number of our project.

03:15.310 --> 03:18.790
So for me it's 17, so I'll enter in 17 like so.

03:20.170 --> 03:23.870
After that, we are being asked to set a default region and zone.

03:23.890 --> 03:25.210
We want to do this.

03:25.210 --> 03:27.970
So we're going to enter in a yes or Y for yes.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.300
And it will be given a big list of regions here.

03:31.780 --> 03:33.670
We're going to find the region.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.100
That we selected when we created our Kubernetes cluster just a moment ago.

03:38.340 --> 03:41.570
So you might recall that I created my cluster in US Central one.

03:41.580 --> 03:46.800
See, if you don't remember where you created yours, you can go back to the Kubernetes menu by clicking

03:46.800 --> 03:51.570
the menu on the top left hand side, then going down to Kubernetes engine and clusters.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.370
And we'll take you back to the screen.

03:53.940 --> 03:57.360
You can then find location right there, and that is your region.

03:57.750 --> 04:01.800
So you're going to find that location on this list and then find the corresponding number.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.140
So for me, it was US Central one, see?

04:04.140 --> 04:05.790
So my number is seven.

04:06.600 --> 04:11.130
If you do not see your number listed on here, you'll notice that in the help options down here, there

04:11.130 --> 04:13.170
are many more regions available.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.430
And if you don't see yours listed, you'll enter in the word list and then hit enter and we'll show

04:17.430 --> 04:19.350
you all the additional regions.

04:20.260 --> 04:20.530
Okay.

04:20.530 --> 04:23.110
So I'm going to enter in number seven in my case and hit enter.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.090
And that is pretty much it.

04:26.650 --> 04:30.440
So we have now set up Google Cloud and we've told it about our account.

04:30.460 --> 04:35.740
We've logged in, we've told it about our project and we told it about the region that we are connecting

04:35.740 --> 04:36.010
to.

04:36.040 --> 04:40.240
Technically, its region and zone are two different things, but I'm going to use the terms a little

04:40.240 --> 04:43.030
bit interchangeably here because it's just not super relevant for us.

04:43.840 --> 04:44.110
Okay.

04:44.110 --> 04:46.700
So we've now just configured Google Cloud SDK.

04:46.720 --> 04:52.300
We have not begun to tell Google Cloud SDK to manage this context stuff.

04:52.450 --> 04:54.040
We're going to take a quick pause right here.

04:54.040 --> 04:59.170
And then in the next video, we will tell Google Cloud that we want it to handle all this context stuff

04:59.170 --> 04:59.920
and tell it.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.530
Tell you how to connect to our cluster.
