00:00.900 --> 00:04.000
In this video, we're going to sign up for a new Google Cloud account.

00:04.020 --> 00:08.480
Now, when you sign up for an account, you get automatically $300 in free credit.

00:08.490 --> 00:12.990
If you already have a Google Cloud account, you might want to create a brand new account just so you

00:12.990 --> 00:18.090
can get those $300 in free credits to guarantee that you will not have to spend anything in this course.

00:18.090 --> 00:22.650
But at any rate, I'm going to leave it up to you whether you use an existing account or create a new

00:22.650 --> 00:23.040
one.

00:23.770 --> 00:28.270
So to get started, we're going to open up a new browser tab and navigate to cloud google.com.

00:28.690 --> 00:29.320
Free.

00:30.110 --> 00:32.270
And you should see a page that looks like this right here.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.220
There are many pages you can go to to sign up for a new account.

00:35.240 --> 00:40.010
I point out this one in particular, just because it gives you some information about this free tier

00:40.010 --> 00:40.820
that they have.

00:41.540 --> 00:43.100
There will be a blue button right here.

00:43.100 --> 00:46.610
If you are not signed in, it will say something like sign up for a new account.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.000
Otherwise, if you're already signed in, it will say something like Go to console.

00:50.510 --> 00:53.330
So if you do not have an account, click on create an account.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.870
It will then prompt you to enter in your region in the world.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.430
So enter in your region.

00:58.490 --> 01:01.880
It will then prompt you to enter in some billing details.

01:01.910 --> 01:04.820
You'll also be asked if you are an individual or a business.

01:04.850 --> 01:09.590
Chances are you're an individual, so change the a little dropdown to say you're an individual and then

01:09.590 --> 01:11.270
enter in those billing details.

01:11.300 --> 01:15.920
Again, this entire option requires a credit card, even though we will probably not be spending any

01:15.920 --> 01:17.690
money thanks to this free credit.

01:19.350 --> 01:23.580
Now, once you go through that sign up process, you'll eventually be dumped at a page that looks like

01:23.580 --> 01:24.390
this right here.

01:24.600 --> 01:30.420
This is the Google Cloud console, and we can use this page to navigate through a ton of different features.

01:31.660 --> 01:34.660
The first thing we're going to do here is sign up for a new project.

01:34.840 --> 01:39.310
So at the very top left hand side, you're going to see something that maybe says my first project or

01:39.310 --> 01:40.210
something similar.

01:40.510 --> 01:41.950
I'm going to click that dropdown.

01:42.580 --> 01:46.060
Then on the right hand side, at the very top, I'm going to click on New Project.

01:47.430 --> 01:49.200
LC A window like this right here.

01:49.440 --> 01:55.770
I'm going to create a new project name with something like about ticketing dash dev.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.010
I'll then click on Create.

01:58.430 --> 02:00.950
Now, very importantly, this happens all the time.

02:00.950 --> 02:05.270
When you first create a project, you do not immediately jump into that project.

02:05.300 --> 02:09.710
In other words, this dashboard over here is still showing just my general dashboard.

02:10.070 --> 02:13.250
A little pop up on the very top right hand side will probably open.

02:13.250 --> 02:14.660
Or if it doesn't, there's give me a little button.

02:14.660 --> 02:18.050
You can click right there and it will say that it's creating the project.

02:18.050 --> 02:21.200
So it actually takes a minute or two to create the project itself.

02:21.410 --> 02:24.920
So wait for that thing to be created and we'll click on the project.

02:26.770 --> 02:28.600
And then we'll see a little jump.

02:29.020 --> 02:33.790
We'll notice that the project selector up here at the top left now says ticketing dev.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.420
And now we can start to use this dashboard under this project.

02:38.610 --> 02:39.030
Okay.

02:39.030 --> 02:40.610
So that's some initial setup.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.680
Let's take a pause right here and continue in just a moment.
