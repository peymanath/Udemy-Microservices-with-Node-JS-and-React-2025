00:00.910 --> 00:05.140
In this video, we're going to do a little bit of basic setup of the expiration service.

00:05.140 --> 00:09.310
So we're going to create a new sub project directory, install some dependencies, all that kind of

00:09.310 --> 00:10.270
low level stuff.

00:10.270 --> 00:11.500
Let's get to it right away.

00:12.380 --> 00:16.520
Back inside of my editor, I'm going to create a new directory called Expiration.

00:17.500 --> 00:17.710
Now.

00:17.710 --> 00:23.860
I would love to add in a ton of stuff for this base project from scratch, but just to save time in

00:23.860 --> 00:28.240
the context of this course, we're going to instead copy over a couple of different files from our ticket

00:28.240 --> 00:30.220
service just to save some time.

00:30.940 --> 00:37.150
So inside of my tickets directory I'm going to do a multi select of Docker, ignore the Docker file

00:37.360 --> 00:40.840
package JSON and the config JSON file as well.

00:41.590 --> 00:44.800
Once I've got all four files, I'm then going to copy all of them.

00:46.770 --> 00:50.250
And then paste them into the expiration directory that we just created.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.740
Inside of exploration.

00:53.740 --> 00:57.040
I'm also going to create a Z directory.

00:58.240 --> 01:04.220
And we'll copy over one or two things from the Z folder inside of tickets inside of the ticket service.

01:04.240 --> 01:10.870
I'll find the SSC directory and once again we will do a multi select this time of Nats wrapper index,

01:10.870 --> 01:13.330
RTS and the MOX directory.

01:13.510 --> 01:14.980
So three things in total.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.480
I'm going to copy those three things.

01:18.470 --> 01:22.910
And then paste them into the Exploration Service's CRC directory that we just created.

01:24.390 --> 01:27.770
So at this point you should have an identical directory structure.

01:27.780 --> 01:28.570
Please double check.

01:28.590 --> 01:32.670
Just make sure you've got everything identical to what I show inside the expiration service.

01:34.040 --> 01:34.200
Okay.

01:34.310 --> 01:38.390
Once you've got that all set up, we're then going to go through a couple of these different files and

01:38.390 --> 01:43.130
just clean them up, get them ready for the expiration service instead of the very particular setup

01:43.130 --> 01:44.750
they have for the ticket service.

01:45.470 --> 01:47.690
Well, first begin with the package JSON file.

01:48.230 --> 01:52.610
So we're going to go through here and remove a couple of different dependencies and add one or two as

01:52.610 --> 01:53.060
well.

01:55.130 --> 01:58.400
Inside of the package JSON file inside the expiration service.

01:58.580 --> 02:01.520
We'll update the name right here to expiration.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.400
Not actually required, but might as well do it while we're here.

02:05.740 --> 02:08.110
Well, then go and take a look at our dependency list.

02:08.930 --> 02:14.720
We've got a lot of dependencies inside of here related to handling network requests or HTTP requests,

02:14.810 --> 02:20.220
specifically everything around express tokens and sessions, cookies, all that stuff.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.920
We do not need any of that stuff for the expiration service, so we're going to remove a lot of these

02:24.920 --> 02:26.000
different dependencies.

02:26.450 --> 02:30.260
I'm going to highlight everything from type's cookie session right here.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.280
All the way down to Mongoose.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.560
Update if current.

02:35.690 --> 02:38.120
And I'm going to delete all those dependencies.

02:39.020 --> 02:42.200
So now we are left with just for just the four you see right here.

02:44.500 --> 02:49.480
Next up inside the dev dependency section, I'm going to delete types super test.

02:50.720 --> 02:55.940
I will delete MongoDB memory server and I will delete super test as well.

02:56.860 --> 02:58.620
So we're left with just these three.

02:58.630 --> 02:59.530
Nothing else.

03:01.720 --> 03:02.080
Okay.

03:02.110 --> 03:02.800
Looks good.

03:03.420 --> 03:04.680
I'm going to save this file.

03:04.710 --> 03:09.090
We'll then go back over to our terminal and we're going to install these dependencies and add in one

03:09.090 --> 03:10.170
or two others.

03:11.330 --> 03:16.460
So back at my terminal, I've already changed into my new expiration directory to make sure you change

03:16.460 --> 03:17.930
into expiration as well.

03:18.890 --> 03:23.120
Then once inside there, we're going to install two packages.

03:23.810 --> 03:24.740
One is both.

03:24.740 --> 03:27.920
So that is the job processing manager that we're going to use.

03:29.720 --> 03:33.050
We're also going to get the type definition file for ball as well.

03:33.050 --> 03:34.990
So that's at types ball.

03:37.140 --> 03:38.040
I'm going to run that.

03:39.300 --> 03:43.860
And when we run an install for these two packages, those are the only packages that get installed.

03:43.890 --> 03:48.570
We then have to run a normal NPM install to make sure that everything else we list inside of our package

03:48.570 --> 03:50.670
JSON file gets added in as well.

03:51.300 --> 03:55.380
So after that first command completes, I'll then do a normal NPM install.

03:57.790 --> 03:58.090
All right.

03:58.090 --> 03:59.200
That's going to take a moment or two.

03:59.230 --> 04:00.460
So I'll just let it do its thing.

04:00.460 --> 04:04.330
And I'm going to flip back over where we will keep doing just a little bit of additional setup.

04:07.450 --> 04:11.410
So next thing we're going to do is take a look at our indexed file and we're going to clean up a lot

04:11.410 --> 04:14.830
of stuff inside of here that is not going to be used inside of our exploration service.

04:15.760 --> 04:20.560
So inside of index keys, again, inside the expiration service, I'm going to delete the import for

04:20.560 --> 04:21.250
Mongoose.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.500
I'll delete the import for app.

04:24.730 --> 04:27.400
I'll delete the two imports for these two listeners.

04:32.340 --> 04:37.830
Well, then start to clean up these 2/1 environment variable checks so we don't need a JSON web token

04:37.830 --> 04:41.880
key or a mongo URI, but we will leave around the next three.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.890
Then going down a little bit.

04:44.900 --> 04:51.650
We still need all this stuff around Nats wrapper, the Nats wrapper, client clothes and the processed

04:51.650 --> 04:52.940
stuff right there as well.

04:54.150 --> 04:58.140
But then after that, we're going to delete the two listeners.

04:59.990 --> 05:04.730
We'll delete the Mongoose Kinect statement and the console log that says Connected to MongoDB.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.150
And then finally, we will delete the app.

05:08.150 --> 05:08.540
Listen.

05:08.540 --> 05:09.800
Call at the very bottom.

05:12.020 --> 05:12.950
And that's it.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.070
So I'll save this file and close it.

05:19.470 --> 05:21.540
Two other files I want to check really quickly.

05:21.540 --> 05:23.160
So if we take a look at Nat's wrapper.

05:23.580 --> 05:26.480
All right, we just have some stuff inside of here around that mock.

05:26.490 --> 05:28.230
Nothing we really need to fix up right now.

05:28.930 --> 05:34.210
And then inside the nats wrapper file, we do have an import for node net streaming.

05:34.210 --> 05:35.020
That's fine.

05:35.140 --> 05:37.300
We are seeing a couple of errors here around TypeScript.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.800
You may or may not see these errors at all.

05:39.820 --> 05:41.800
If you do see these errors like I do.

05:41.830 --> 05:45.160
The way to fix them is once again command shift p on your keyboard.

05:46.190 --> 05:48.680
And search for reload window.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.800
Alternatively, you can just restart your editor.

05:54.000 --> 05:54.300
All right.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.040
That looks a lot better for me.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.810
So that's pretty much it with some initial setup.

05:58.830 --> 06:00.060
We're going to take a pause right here.

06:00.060 --> 06:04.680
When we come back, the next video, we're going to build an initial Docker image for this exploration

06:04.680 --> 06:05.310
service.

06:05.310 --> 06:10.080
We'll then create a couple of different Kubernetes config files to create a new deployment for our exploration

06:10.080 --> 06:13.020
service and also create that Redis instance as well.
