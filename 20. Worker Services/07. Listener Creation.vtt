WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:05.020
All of the initial setup for our exploration and service is complete, so now we can start to focus

00:05.020 --> 00:06.640
on the actual application logic.

00:06.970 --> 00:10.140
We're going to implement this and kind of a top down approach.

00:10.150 --> 00:14.290
So we're going to first focus on creating a listener to watch for the order created event.

00:14.620 --> 00:19.480
We'll then make sure that we start to set up something with Bull JS and then eventually create our publisher

00:19.480 --> 00:21.400
for the exploration complete event.

00:21.970 --> 00:24.940
So let's first get started with the order created listener.

00:25.820 --> 00:31.550
Inside of my expiration service in the CRC directory, I'm going to make a new folder called Events.

00:32.690 --> 00:35.930
Inside there, I'm going to create a new folder of listeners.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.470
And then inside of that, I'll make a new file of order.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.750
Created listener dots.

00:47.320 --> 00:51.310
So this listener is going to be very similar to all the listeners we put together before we're going

00:51.310 --> 00:53.410
to subclass our listener base class.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.270
We're going to set up the on message function and then run some business logic inside there.

00:58.870 --> 00:59.560
Pretty straightforward.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.350
We've gone through this several times, so let's just get right to it.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.770
First off, I'm going to get my listener base glass.

01:08.130 --> 01:09.330
From my common module.

01:11.020 --> 01:12.370
Well, then exports.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.100
A new class called Order Created Listener.

01:16.490 --> 01:18.920
That's going to be extending the listener.

01:22.140 --> 01:24.460
And we can pretty much allow TypeScript to guide us from there.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.860
Just in case you forgot how all this stuff comes together.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.810
So once again, immediately, we've really been through this.

01:29.820 --> 01:33.000
Remember, we have to plug in the type of event that we want to listen for.

01:33.940 --> 01:36.880
So I'm going to get the order created event.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.160
Plug it in as the generic type.

01:41.970 --> 01:44.770
We will then be told that we have to supply on message.

01:44.790 --> 01:46.380
Q Group name and subject.

01:47.070 --> 01:49.710
Let's take care of subject first, so I'll get my subjects in.

01:51.210 --> 01:57.780
And then say that subject is going to be of type subject start order created and its value will be subjects

01:58.380 --> 01:59.400
order created.

02:01.710 --> 02:03.030
Then our group name.

02:03.030 --> 02:07.760
Once again, we will create a group name inside of a separate file just to avoid any typos.

02:07.770 --> 02:12.600
I don't really expect to have any other listeners, but it's still nice to follow the same pattern inside

02:12.600 --> 02:13.740
the listeners directory.

02:13.770 --> 02:15.180
I'll make a new folder of Q.

02:15.210 --> 02:16.410
Group name.

02:16.870 --> 02:17.230
Yes.

02:17.460 --> 02:17.730
Sorry.

02:17.730 --> 02:19.770
I think I might have said folder meant to say file.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.150
So file of Q group name?

02:21.270 --> 02:21.810
Yes.

02:22.620 --> 02:26.070
And then I will export Colin's du group name.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.060
And we'll give this one a name of expiration.

02:30.900 --> 02:31.620
Service.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.700
Back over inside the listener.

02:38.480 --> 02:39.380
At the very top.

02:41.690 --> 02:42.860
Let's get our cue.

02:42.890 --> 02:43.940
Group name.

02:47.090 --> 02:48.500
From that file we just created.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.710
Assign it as a property to the class.

02:57.060 --> 02:59.580
And then define our on message function.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.500
As usual, this thing is going to receive two arguments.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.790
So data that will be of type order created event specifically the data property.

03:06.790 --> 03:10.300
So order created event at data.

03:13.050 --> 03:16.830
And then our message which we have type message and that is coming from.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.010
The Node gnat streaming library.

03:22.360 --> 03:22.550
Okay.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.410
So good start.

03:25.120 --> 03:28.230
Well, that is pretty much it for step number one right here.

03:28.240 --> 03:32.800
So from here on out, we're going to have to start to focus on exactly how we work with blogs and how

03:32.800 --> 03:36.190
we're going to tell it, to remind us to do something in 15 minutes.

03:36.520 --> 03:41.500
So let's start to get a deeper overview of what's going on with the Bulge Library in the next video.
