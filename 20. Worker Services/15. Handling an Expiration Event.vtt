00:00.730 --> 00:05.580
We are all done with our exploration service and it is now emitting the exploration complete event.

00:05.590 --> 00:09.970
So we're now going to travel back in time, go back over to the oil service and make sure that we build

00:09.970 --> 00:12.040
a listener to listen for this event.

00:12.520 --> 00:17.440
As soon as the Order Service sees exploration complete, we're going to find the relevant order inside

00:17.440 --> 00:20.320
the order's collection and market as cancelled.

00:20.860 --> 00:25.570
We might have to do one or two other things related to canceling in order, but we'll discuss that in

00:25.570 --> 00:26.260
due time.

00:26.710 --> 00:31.720
When we cancel the order, we are probably also going to want to emit an order cancelled event from

00:31.720 --> 00:33.130
the order service as well.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.660
But right now, let's just focus on the order service and the listener for exploration complete.

00:39.230 --> 00:44.240
Now to build out this listener, we first need to update our common module inside of the Order Service.

00:44.390 --> 00:49.640
Remember, we update our module just a moment ago and add it in the expiration complete event, but

00:49.640 --> 00:53.210
we never updated the version of that module inside of our order service.

00:54.170 --> 00:55.370
So back at my terminal.

00:57.180 --> 01:00.300
I'm going to change into orders and then update.

01:01.430 --> 01:02.720
My comment module.

01:08.130 --> 01:08.430
All right.

01:08.430 --> 01:09.090
Very good.

01:09.780 --> 01:11.190
Now go back over to my editor.

01:11.730 --> 01:13.800
I'm going to find my orders directory.

01:14.250 --> 01:20.100
I'll find listeners inside there, and we'll add in a brand new listener with the name of, you guessed

01:20.100 --> 01:22.080
it, expiration.

01:23.190 --> 01:24.810
Complete listener.

01:25.440 --> 01:26.000
Yes.

01:27.770 --> 01:27.910
Now.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.140
We put together several listeners over time, but I don't know about you.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.350
I just have a hard time of remembering how to put these things together.

01:34.370 --> 01:36.980
Just remember, you can always rely on TypeScript.

01:37.070 --> 01:41.030
The one thing at a minimum, we have to remember, we have to import listener.

01:41.940 --> 01:43.260
From our common module.

01:43.960 --> 01:47.260
We can then make our class of exploration complete.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.550
Listener.

01:51.350 --> 01:54.590
That will extend listener and then TypeScript is going to take it from there.

01:54.890 --> 01:58.310
We've been over this many times, so let's just speed through the rest of this implementation.

01:58.580 --> 02:02.000
We need to import our event to provide to the generic type.

02:02.030 --> 02:04.710
We need to import our group name subjects.

02:04.730 --> 02:09.170
We've got to get our message type and we've got to get I think that's it, actually.

02:09.650 --> 02:10.550
So from listener.

02:11.660 --> 02:13.060
Let's get the subject now.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.180
And the expiration complete event.

02:17.140 --> 02:19.900
We'll get our message type.

02:20.770 --> 02:22.540
From node nets streaming.

02:25.170 --> 02:26.430
And then what else.

02:26.880 --> 02:27.440
I think that's.

02:27.450 --> 02:27.900
Is that it?

02:27.900 --> 02:30.150
I think I feel like I mentioned one other, but whatever.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.070
Oh, the Q group name, naturally.

02:32.640 --> 02:33.420
There we go.

02:35.580 --> 02:36.450
From same directory.

02:36.630 --> 02:37.130
Group name.

02:37.140 --> 02:37.830
There we go.

02:38.010 --> 02:42.000
Okay, so now on our listener, we'll stick in that type expiration complete event.

02:43.110 --> 02:44.880
Throw in the Q group name.

02:47.940 --> 02:49.830
Throw in a subject of subjects.

02:50.190 --> 02:51.960
Exploration complete.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.720
Subjects exploration complete.

02:55.500 --> 03:00.330
And then finally on message work that as a sink.

03:01.250 --> 03:06.590
Receive some data which will be of type expiration complete event at data.

03:07.310 --> 03:09.890
And then get our message, which is subtype message.

03:10.800 --> 03:11.160
There we go.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.090
There's our listener.

03:12.690 --> 03:15.540
Again, it's all the same stuff between all these different listeners.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.310
I tried to factor all this code down to be the absolute minimum, and this is pretty much what I came

03:20.310 --> 03:20.940
up with.

03:20.970 --> 03:25.350
We could probably figure out a way to more easily generalize cue group name, but in general this is

03:25.350 --> 03:26.490
pretty darn compact.

03:27.480 --> 03:27.720
All right.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.010
Anyways, back on topic.

03:29.430 --> 03:34.770
So we've got this incoming data that describes some order or the attempt to say that an order should

03:34.770 --> 03:35.640
be cancelled.

03:35.970 --> 03:40.350
The first thing we have to do is take a look inside of our orders collection and find the relevant order.

03:40.860 --> 03:41.760
So at the very top.

03:44.010 --> 03:45.780
Let's import our order.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.370
From up to directories.

03:48.370 --> 03:49.540
Models order.

03:53.510 --> 03:56.720
Then instead of on message, we can find our order.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.390
So we'll do an await order.

03:59.600 --> 04:04.670
Find by ID and remember this event right here has one single property.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.920
It has the order ID property.

04:06.920 --> 04:11.150
And if we ever forget that, naturally we can do a command click on expiration and complete event at

04:11.150 --> 04:12.470
the top and we'll tell us.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.820
Okay, here's the data property.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.080
It has an order ID.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.090
So that is the idea of the order that we want to find.

04:18.180 --> 04:22.110
So inside of find by ID, we will reference data order ID.

04:23.960 --> 04:28.160
Then as usual, TypeScript is not sure if this thing is actually defined or not, so we just have to

04:28.160 --> 04:29.120
do a quick check.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.680
Make sure that order is defined.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.370
So if there's not an order.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.970
Let's throw a new air and say border not found.

04:44.340 --> 04:46.890
Then after that, we need to update this thing status.

04:47.310 --> 04:50.640
To update the status, we're going to need that order status enum.

04:50.670 --> 04:55.020
Remember, we had previously defined that inside of our common module and that was going to describe

04:55.020 --> 04:57.300
all the possible statuses that an order can have.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.350
So we will import order status from our common module.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.560
Then right after the if statement we'll do an order set up.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.620
Not that set.

05:13.630 --> 05:14.320
There we go.

05:14.920 --> 05:19.630
And I want to change the status to order status that cancelled.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.760
And there might be one other thing we should do here as well.

05:24.760 --> 05:30.100
Remember, the order is going to contain a reference directly to the ticket that it is reserving.

05:30.370 --> 05:35.170
And so we need to kind of make a decision here and decide whether or not we want to clear out that reference.

05:35.170 --> 05:41.470
So, in other words, whether we want to say ticket is something like NULL, does that make sense or

05:41.470 --> 05:42.010
does it not?

05:42.040 --> 05:43.780
Should we keep a reference to the order?

05:44.080 --> 05:46.280
Well, that's something that we should probably discuss a little bit.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.530
So let's take a quick pause right here.

05:47.530 --> 05:48.280
I'm going to save this file.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.340
That's why you're seeing my code jump all over the place so I can say this file.

05:51.340 --> 05:55.480
We'll take a quick pause, and we're going to decide whether or not it makes sense to reset the ticket

05:55.480 --> 05:57.670
property on this newly canceled order.

05:57.820 --> 06:00.580
The quick pause right here, and we'll continue in just a moment.
