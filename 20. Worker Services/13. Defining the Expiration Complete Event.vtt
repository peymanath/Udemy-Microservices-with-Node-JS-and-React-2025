00:00.770 --> 00:05.150
Well, it's been just about a minute for me and I see this console.log right here that says I want to

00:05.150 --> 00:07.220
publish the expiration complete event.

00:07.550 --> 00:08.000
Awesome.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.170
So definitely looks good.

00:09.470 --> 00:15.470
We've now got the entire mechanism of receiving an event, publishing a job, receiving the job, processing

00:15.470 --> 00:20.510
it, and then potentially we don't quite have it yet, but we now need to make sure that we publish

00:20.510 --> 00:22.940
an event of type expiration complete.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.220
That's we're going to start to work on in this video.

00:25.430 --> 00:30.590
We first need to make sure that our common module has the definition for an expiration complete type

00:30.590 --> 00:31.220
event.

00:32.370 --> 00:33.360
So to get started.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.280
Oh, wrong screen to get started.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.140
I'm going to go back over to my common module.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.090
And remember what we do to create a new event.

00:41.110 --> 00:45.520
We'll find the events directory and then inside of here we're going to create a new one of these event

00:45.520 --> 00:46.300
files.

00:46.780 --> 00:51.850
Every event file is going to export a single interface named after the event that we're trying to create.

00:52.240 --> 00:56.860
We also need to make sure we have a new subject that describes this event, and we'll also enter in

00:56.860 --> 00:59.740
some data that is going to be contained inside the event as well.

01:00.370 --> 01:04.630
So in our case, we are trying to create an event of type expiration complete.

01:04.990 --> 01:08.200
That means we'll first open up our subjects in them file.

01:09.340 --> 01:15.910
I'll add in a new subject of exploration complete and give it a value of exploration colon.

01:16.630 --> 01:17.260
Complete.

01:20.610 --> 01:25.350
After that, inside the events directory, I'll make a new file of expiration.

01:25.980 --> 01:28.020
Complete event.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.610
That's.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.950
At the very top, we will import that subjects in them.

01:36.680 --> 01:42.470
And then I will export an interface called expiration complete event.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.670
This will have a subject of subject's exploration complete.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.360
And they'll list out the data contained inside this thing as well.

01:51.570 --> 01:55.680
And as we previously discussed, the only thing we really need to communicate inside this event is the

01:55.680 --> 01:56.430
order ID.

01:56.460 --> 02:01.170
There's not really anything else we need to communicate to say, Hey, something has expired.

02:01.530 --> 02:03.470
That's all we're going to be communicating inside of here.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.740
Just the order ID.

02:05.660 --> 02:10.370
So for data we'll say order ID and this will be of type string.

02:11.070 --> 02:12.180
And that's pretty much it.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.240
Just creating this event file is not quite enough.

02:17.260 --> 02:22.720
However, remember, we do have to make sure we export it from our index file inside of the common module.

02:23.630 --> 02:25.600
So this is where we have all of our different experts.

02:25.610 --> 02:29.810
I'll go down to the bottom and I'll add on yet another from events.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.160
Exploration complete event.

02:35.000 --> 02:35.100
Yeah.

02:35.180 --> 02:35.930
That looks good.

02:37.240 --> 02:41.890
It will now republish our common module and then update the common module version used inside of our

02:41.890 --> 02:46.330
exploration service will then be able to create a publisher for exploration complete.

02:47.540 --> 02:48.590
Back at my terminal.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.830
I will change into my exploration directory.

02:54.490 --> 02:55.150
Or excuse me.

02:55.170 --> 02:56.130
Common module first.

02:56.130 --> 02:57.360
Got to update the thing.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.930
So in the common module, we'll do an AMPM run pub.

03:01.230 --> 03:01.890
Here we go.

03:03.760 --> 03:07.840
And then we can go back over to the expiration service and update the version used inside there.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.810
All right, so now back over to expiration.

03:12.830 --> 03:13.730
That's better.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.780
And we'll do an RPM update or our common module.

03:21.180 --> 03:23.790
It looks like I am on version 1023.

03:25.180 --> 03:27.840
I'll just make sure that after the update runs, I see the same version.

03:29.820 --> 03:30.150
Yep.

03:30.150 --> 03:30.840
Looks good.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.290
I remember since we made a change to our package based on file.

03:34.320 --> 03:39.330
Scaffold is going to want to rebuild or technically docker here is going to rebuild our expiration service

03:39.330 --> 03:39.970
image.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.180
That's going to take a minute or two.

03:41.190 --> 03:42.210
So we'll take a pause right here.

03:42.210 --> 03:46.710
And when we come back, the next video, we'll make sure that we've got a publisher inside of our expiration

03:46.710 --> 03:49.830
service that is going to publish that event that we just created.
