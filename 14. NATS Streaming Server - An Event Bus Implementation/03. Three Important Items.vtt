00:01.130 --> 00:04.730
In this video, we're going to do some initial setup of the Net's streaming server.

00:04.760 --> 00:08.630
I first want to give you just a couple of very high level notes on it, and then we're going to start

00:08.630 --> 00:13.610
to deploy it into our Kubernetes cluster by writing, as you'd guess, a config file.

00:14.210 --> 00:15.200
So a couple of notes here.

00:15.470 --> 00:20.840
So we're making use of something called Nats streaming server to share events across all the different

00:20.840 --> 00:22.550
services inside of our application.

00:23.030 --> 00:28.520
You can find documentation for nats streaming server at dock's nats io.

00:29.210 --> 00:30.620
So I'm going to go there right now.

00:31.190 --> 00:32.750
Here's the documentation page.

00:33.380 --> 00:37.560
Now, something that is extremely important for you to understand right from the get go.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.170
This is extremely important.

00:39.200 --> 00:44.180
You are going to see a terminology of simply gnats and gnats streaming server.

00:44.570 --> 00:50.180
These are two separate programs, two different things, and they behave pretty darn differently.

00:50.540 --> 00:52.460
We are not making use of gnats.

00:52.490 --> 00:58.670
Gnats is a very simple, basic implementation of event sharing and that streaming server is built on

00:58.670 --> 00:59.810
top of gnats.

00:59.840 --> 01:05.300
It is a more advanced and more full of feature implementation that we are going to be making use of.

01:05.450 --> 01:11.180
So in all the documentation that we look at, in all the deployment instructions, everything, we always

01:11.180 --> 01:17.300
want to be making sure that we're taking a look at something that says Gnats streaming server 100% of

01:17.300 --> 01:17.930
the time.

01:18.470 --> 01:22.880
Having said that, throughout the remainder of this course, and particularly in this section, whenever

01:22.880 --> 01:27.710
I want to refer to that streaming server, I'm going to very frequently say simply gnats, just because

01:27.710 --> 01:31.640
saying that streaming server over and over and over again is going to be really annoying.

01:32.290 --> 01:36.370
So for you, just keep in mind, we're always going to want to look at documentation around Nats streaming

01:36.370 --> 01:39.430
server and this applies even to the official documentation.

01:39.730 --> 01:43.960
Once we come over here on the left hand side, we're going to see stuff that says Nat's concepts developing

01:43.960 --> 01:45.100
with Nat's and so on.

01:45.430 --> 01:49.780
That is all references to just plain Nat's, which we're not using.

01:49.780 --> 01:51.580
We are using Nat's streaming server.

01:51.580 --> 01:55.240
So the documentation we want to look at, we're going to scroll down on the left hand side.

01:56.330 --> 01:59.180
And eventually find Nats streaming concepts.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.930
These are the documentation sections we care about.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.990
Here is developing with Nat streaming.

02:05.000 --> 02:05.990
Yep we care about that.

02:05.990 --> 02:07.210
And here's nat streaming server.

02:07.220 --> 02:08.390
Yep, we care about that.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.870
So again, make sure you are not reading about Nats.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.060
Make sure you are reading about Nat's streaming server.

02:14.850 --> 02:15.070
Okay.

02:15.150 --> 02:16.110
So that might.

02:17.330 --> 02:22.520
Some of the different features of Nat streaming are going to be absolutely tremendous in how we eventually

02:22.520 --> 02:26.600
start to implement some of our different services and particularly how we shared data between them.

02:26.780 --> 02:30.620
So in the coming videos, we're going to get Nat streaming server up and running inside of our Kubernetes

02:30.620 --> 02:31.190
cluster.

02:31.220 --> 02:35.840
We're going to create a very small little project where we are just writing out some Node.js code to

02:35.840 --> 02:40.550
work with Nat streaming server directly so we can get a better idea of how it behaves, how it shares

02:40.550 --> 02:43.230
information around how events get persisted.

02:43.250 --> 02:47.780
How we can somehow synchronize new services that we add into our application and so on.

02:48.750 --> 02:53.730
We are going to run now streaming server inside of our Kubernetes cluster by using the official Docker

02:53.730 --> 02:55.710
image called Nats streaming.

02:56.100 --> 03:01.200
Let's go take a look at the image documentation on Docker Hub right now, just so we have a better idea

03:01.200 --> 03:02.850
of how we can get this thing up and running.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.030
So inside of a second browser tab, I'm going to navigate to Hub Docker.

03:08.740 --> 03:11.680
And then once here I will search for Nats at the top.

03:12.840 --> 03:14.290
And again, we're going to see it.

03:14.310 --> 03:18.090
One image called Nats and another called Nats streaming.

03:18.420 --> 03:21.930
So again, we want to make sure we are always going for nets streaming.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.690
On this page, we can take a look at some documentation.

03:27.170 --> 03:31.820
The documentation I really want to point out to you is at the very, very bottom of this page.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.960
So specifically.

03:35.530 --> 03:37.120
The command line options.

03:37.500 --> 03:42.110
So these are a ton of different options that we can provide when we create our deployment.

03:42.130 --> 03:47.050
I'll show you how we stick these in and these are going to customize Howard Nordstrom server behaves.

03:47.050 --> 03:51.730
Some of these options are really important for us to set and in some cases we definitely do not want

03:51.730 --> 03:53.710
to be using the default settings.

03:54.490 --> 03:54.910
All right.

03:54.910 --> 03:57.300
So in this video, we've really established three things.

03:57.310 --> 04:00.130
Number one, we're using that streaming server, not gnats.

04:01.170 --> 04:04.230
Number two, we're going to take a look at the Nats documentation.

04:04.230 --> 04:07.950
And when we do, we're going to make sure we take a look at the streaming documentation.

04:08.460 --> 04:13.500
And number three, we're going to run that streaming server inside of our Kubernetes cluster by deploying

04:13.500 --> 04:15.450
it like any other service in our app.

04:16.400 --> 04:22.610
And I guess number 3.5 or so, we definitely want to keep this page open, the Docker Hub documentation

04:22.610 --> 04:26.660
on the NAT streaming image so we can take a look at the different command line options that are available

04:26.660 --> 04:27.260
to us.

04:27.860 --> 04:28.280
All right.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.240
So a quick pause right here.

04:29.240 --> 04:33.980
We're going to start to deploy this into our cluster in the next video by writing a deployment.
