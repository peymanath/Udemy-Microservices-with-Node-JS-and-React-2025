00:01.110 --> 00:03.670
Our ticket service is now mostly complete.

00:03.690 --> 00:07.740
We put together the implementation, we got some tests and we've also done some manual testing with

00:07.740 --> 00:08.430
Postman.

00:08.430 --> 00:10.080
So what are we going to work on next?

00:10.110 --> 00:13.530
Well, I think there's a couple of different options available to us.

00:13.890 --> 00:17.310
In total, we're going to go over three possible options on what we could work on right now and then

00:17.310 --> 00:18.600
eventually make a decision.

00:19.080 --> 00:24.150
So option number one, I think we could definitely go over to our next client application and start

00:24.150 --> 00:28.920
to add in some ticket related stuff, such as the ability to view tickets, create them, edit them

00:28.920 --> 00:29.640
and so on.

00:30.520 --> 00:31.660
That could definitely be done.

00:32.170 --> 00:35.860
Another option would be to start to create our orders service.

00:36.010 --> 00:40.420
As a quick reminder, one of the services inside of our project is the order service.

00:40.420 --> 00:45.760
And this thing is going to hold all the information related to a user attempting to purchase a very

00:45.760 --> 00:46.780
particular ticket.

00:48.450 --> 00:50.190
Well, that's definitely another option as well.

00:50.220 --> 00:55.140
The order service is going to add a very base level, going to be somewhat similar in nature to the

00:55.140 --> 01:00.660
ticket service where we're going to be creating updating records, viewing records, stuff like that.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.340
So fairly similar in nature.

01:02.670 --> 01:07.770
And then finally, our last option, we could start to add in some code for handling events.

01:07.770 --> 01:12.360
So in other words, implement the event bus and we could wire it up to the ticket service and get a

01:12.360 --> 01:14.340
better idea of how that thing works.

01:14.940 --> 01:16.340
So which one are we going to go with?

01:16.350 --> 01:18.660
Well, you could probably guess by the title of this section.

01:18.660 --> 01:20.310
We're going to go with option number three.

01:20.730 --> 01:22.860
We're going to start to add in this event bus.

01:22.860 --> 01:25.590
We're going to get a better understanding of how it works and so on.

01:25.800 --> 01:31.650
The reason for this is that understanding some limitations or some properties of our event bus is going

01:31.650 --> 01:38.010
to be absolutely tremendous in understanding how the order service and our ticket service are going

01:38.010 --> 01:38.940
to work together.

01:39.420 --> 01:43.620
So if we take care of this stuff right now, even though we are not going to be really emitting any

01:43.620 --> 01:48.600
events to any other services inside of our app from the ticket service just yet, because we don't have

01:48.600 --> 01:53.250
any other services that care about these events, it's still going to be really important to understand

01:53.250 --> 01:58.590
how the event bus behaves because it's going to really have a big impact on how we build that order

01:58.590 --> 01:59.250
service.

02:00.050 --> 02:05.300
So the event bus in general, just a quick reminder, we're going to implement it with something called

02:05.300 --> 02:06.920
the Nats streaming server.

02:07.220 --> 02:11.680
We had previously on our last application that way smaller application than we started the course with

02:11.690 --> 02:17.180
we had built out our event bus from scratch and that was that very simple express application.

02:17.750 --> 02:20.630
So in the coming videos, we're going to forget.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.050
The service tickets.

02:23.070 --> 02:24.360
All that stuff 100%.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.370
Just ignore it.

02:25.380 --> 02:30.390
And we're going to have a 100% focus on the Nats streaming server, our event bus, and we're going

02:30.390 --> 02:32.940
to get a much better understanding of how it works.

02:32.970 --> 02:38.280
In particular, we're going to draw some parallels and differences compared to the custom very simple

02:38.280 --> 02:42.540
event bus we put together earlier, just to help you understand how this thing really behaves.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.730
So with that in mind, a quick pause right here.

02:44.730 --> 02:49.770
Let's start to work with this Nat streaming server event bus thing in the next video.
