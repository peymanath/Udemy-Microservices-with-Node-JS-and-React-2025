00:00.980 --> 00:05.330
In this video, we're going to take a look at a very easy way to capture the cookie that gets sent back

00:05.330 --> 00:10.010
to us during this initial request and include that cookie in the follow up request right after it.

00:10.250 --> 00:13.340
We're going to first take a look at this very easy way of handling this.

00:13.340 --> 00:17.690
But then after that, we're going to start to do a little bit larger refactor to make it really easy

00:17.690 --> 00:19.820
to make authenticated requests in the future.

00:19.820 --> 00:24.230
Because, again, just about every other service we're going to put together and write test for, we're

00:24.230 --> 00:27.010
going to have to be authenticated to make requests to it.

00:27.020 --> 00:31.760
So we want to make sure that in a testing environment, it is really, really easy to get authenticated.

00:32.260 --> 00:34.520
Okay, so here's the very easy solution.

00:34.940 --> 00:39.350
We're going to first take a look at the initial request right here, which should be giving us back

00:39.350 --> 00:40.010
a cookie.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.220
I'm going to capture the response so we get sent.

00:43.230 --> 00:49.620
So I will call this something like off response, maybe a better name for it would be like sign up response

00:49.620 --> 00:50.550
or something like that.

00:50.970 --> 00:54.300
So inside there is going to be the cookie that we actually care about.

00:55.080 --> 01:01.110
So we can extract that thing using response or off response.

01:01.490 --> 01:02.430
Target.

01:03.000 --> 01:03.540
Set.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.200
Cookie.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.170
So we are pulling off that authentication cookie.

01:07.170 --> 01:10.170
That is the thing that contains our JSON web token inside of it.

01:10.530 --> 01:14.910
We now want to take that cookie and include it in this follow up request that we're making right here.

01:15.270 --> 01:18.710
We can do so very easily by right after the get.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.530
We're going to add in another change on method of set.

01:22.740 --> 01:26.200
We can use set to set different headers on the request are about to make.

01:26.220 --> 01:29.070
So in this case, we're going to set the cookie header.

01:29.740 --> 01:33.910
And we'll set it to the cookie that we got from the initial response.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.550
We'll put in cookie like so.

01:38.960 --> 01:42.290
All right, so let's now save this flight back over to our terminal.

01:43.310 --> 01:44.570
Tests are rerunning.

01:46.130 --> 01:46.910
And there we go.

01:46.910 --> 01:48.260
There is our current user.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.580
Now, we could very easily write out a test and make sure that there is a current user property that

01:52.580 --> 01:55.790
is defined and that there are some kind of email defined on there as well.

01:56.450 --> 02:05.000
So for example, I'm going to replace the console.log right here within expect response dot body dot

02:05.000 --> 02:07.460
current user dot email.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.530
Two equal.

02:09.800 --> 02:10.820
And we'll have that email.

02:10.820 --> 02:14.330
We'll make sure that it equals the email we had signed up as originally up here.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.250
It will say test at test.

02:18.780 --> 02:19.050
Okay.

02:19.050 --> 02:19.890
Let's save that.

02:20.490 --> 02:25.770
I'm going to flip back over and after these tests run again, we should see now current user is passing.

02:26.070 --> 02:26.700
Very good.

02:27.670 --> 02:27.970
All right.

02:27.970 --> 02:29.860
So without a doubt, this approach right here works.

02:29.860 --> 02:35.530
But as I mentioned, every other service that we test, we're going to have to probably initially sign

02:35.530 --> 02:36.520
up somehow.

02:36.700 --> 02:40.870
In other words, we want to be able to make authenticate requests to these other services very, very

02:40.870 --> 02:42.550
easily in a testing environment.

02:42.820 --> 02:44.260
So we're going to take a quick pause right here.

02:44.260 --> 02:48.460
When we come back, the next video, we're going to refactor some of this authentication stuff into

02:48.460 --> 02:50.950
a helper function and this helper function.

02:50.950 --> 02:54.790
We're going to eventually kind of copy paste around to a lot of different services.

02:54.820 --> 02:59.500
It's going to make testing, authentication and making sure we can make authenticated requests really

02:59.500 --> 03:00.730
easy and straightforward.

03:00.940 --> 03:03.250
So a quick pause, and I'll see you in just a minute.
