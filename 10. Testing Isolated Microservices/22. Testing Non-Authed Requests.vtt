00:01.310 --> 00:03.800
One last quick test inside of our current user test file.

00:03.800 --> 00:08.060
So I want to make sure that if we are not signed in, we get back a current user of NULL.

00:08.060 --> 00:10.100
So this will be really easy to put together.

00:10.550 --> 00:17.570
We'll put together another block down here and we'll say it responds with NULL if not authenticated.

00:21.170 --> 00:27.380
Then we'll get our response from a wait request app.

00:28.270 --> 00:31.780
I'm going to make a get request to API users current user.

00:32.500 --> 00:37.480
And then of course this time I'm not going to try to set any cookie because we want to make an unauthenticated

00:37.480 --> 00:38.260
request.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.880
I'm going to send that off.

00:40.740 --> 00:44.580
Even though I am not authenticated, I should still get back a 200.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.500
Let's make sure that's still the case.

00:47.850 --> 00:51.750
Then we could take a look at that response body and make sure that current user is no.

00:52.890 --> 00:56.070
So you could put down expect response dot body.

00:57.580 --> 00:59.230
Current user two.

00:59.230 --> 00:59.890
Equal.

01:00.520 --> 01:01.060
NULL.

01:04.080 --> 01:04.980
So I'm going to save that.

01:05.790 --> 01:06.990
Take a look at our tests.

01:08.880 --> 01:09.570
Very good.

01:10.840 --> 01:11.080
All right.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.410
Well, that is pretty much it for testing on our service.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.170
We've got some tests around all these handlers.

01:17.200 --> 01:21.160
Now, remember, there are two other types of tests we're going to eventually write as well.

01:21.190 --> 01:25.570
We're going to eventually start to write tests around our models and around some event handling stuff

01:25.570 --> 01:26.230
as well.

01:26.410 --> 01:30.880
But our model in this case, the user model, doesn't really have a lot of logic tied to it compared

01:30.880 --> 01:33.270
to some other models we're going to eventually put together.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.190
So I'm not going to worry about writing any tests around the user model just yet.

01:36.340 --> 01:40.510
In addition, we have not wired up any event stuff to our service just yet, so we're not going to worry

01:40.510 --> 01:41.410
about that either.

01:41.770 --> 01:44.260
Let's take a pause right here and continue in just a moment.
