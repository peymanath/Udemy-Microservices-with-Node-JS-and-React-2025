00:01.480 --> 00:03.790
We just got our first test running, which is fantastic.

00:03.790 --> 00:07.360
But before we continue, I want to give you an extremely important note.

00:07.510 --> 00:11.650
Remember, just by itself does not have support for TypeScript out of the box.

00:11.650 --> 00:14.680
So we are using that extra little library that we installed.

00:15.620 --> 00:18.890
Very quickly back inside of our package JSON file we installed.

00:19.340 --> 00:22.940
Jess, that is what gives Jess the ability to understand TypeScript.

00:23.150 --> 00:28.970
Now this library or something inside a chest or something along this entire toolchain sometimes does

00:28.970 --> 00:30.500
not work correctly.

00:30.710 --> 00:33.830
So every now and then I can guarantee you are going to run into this.

00:33.830 --> 00:36.080
Every now and then you're going to see a test failing.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.850
You're then going to go and try to fix it.

00:37.850 --> 00:42.320
You're going to save a file, and then you're going to see that the test is still failing, even if

00:42.320 --> 00:44.600
you really think that you fix the issue up.

00:44.780 --> 00:49.120
So sometimes either gest or test, I don't really know which one is causing the issue.

00:49.130 --> 00:52.820
Sometimes they do not detect changes that you are making to your files.

00:52.880 --> 00:57.770
It is really hard for me to replicate this issue in any way, but it's something that I noticed while

00:57.770 --> 00:59.330
I was developing this application.

00:59.420 --> 01:04.610
So if you ever run into a scenario where a test is failing, you go and change the file and you really

01:04.610 --> 01:05.630
think you fix the issue.

01:05.630 --> 01:06.920
But it's still not passing.

01:07.310 --> 01:08.240
Here's how to solve it.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.770
All you got to do restart.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.000
Just so hit control.

01:11.000 --> 01:11.510
See?

01:12.540 --> 01:17.070
Reran NPM run test and now just should see the updated file.

01:17.220 --> 01:21.630
So again, if you start to make changes and you don't see them reflected in your test suite, just restart.

01:21.630 --> 01:22.560
That's all you got to do.

01:23.220 --> 01:24.420
So that's all I want to mention here.

01:24.420 --> 01:28.290
It is important enough because I don't want you to get it stuck at some point in time trying to figure

01:28.290 --> 01:29.370
out what's going on.

01:29.370 --> 01:30.330
So quick pause.

01:30.330 --> 01:30.780
Continue.

01:30.780 --> 01:31.470
Just a minute.
