00:01.640 --> 00:06.050
In this video, we're going to try to write out a test or two around the sign out functionality.

00:06.320 --> 00:10.190
Now, once again, just like the last video, we're not really going to see anything that new in the

00:10.190 --> 00:11.030
world of testing.

00:11.030 --> 00:15.200
So if you really just want to get on to some the more interesting stuff, skip to the next video once

00:15.200 --> 00:15.530
again.

00:15.530 --> 00:19.580
Otherwise, stick around and let's write out a single test around the sign out route handler.

00:20.260 --> 00:25.720
So once again, inside my test directory, I'll make a new file of sign out tests.

00:26.600 --> 00:31.490
At the top, we will import a request from super test.

00:32.730 --> 00:36.180
And app from up to directories app.

00:38.050 --> 00:42.210
So as you guess, all we really want to do here is attempt to sign up for an account.

00:42.220 --> 00:44.290
Once we sign up, we should be logged in.

00:44.800 --> 00:50.410
And then after that we'll make another request to sign out and we should be able to make a assertion

00:50.410 --> 00:54.820
on the response we get back something to say that the cookie has been cleared or something like that.

00:54.970 --> 00:59.110
We'll probably have to inspect the actual response that gets sent back to figure out exactly how to

00:59.110 --> 01:00.560
write out this expectation.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.800
Let's just get started writing out the test first.

01:03.760 --> 01:09.610
We're going to put together in its statement inside of here, we'll say it clears the cookie after signing

01:09.610 --> 01:10.000
out.

01:13.140 --> 01:17.010
So inside of here again, we need to first sign up for an account so that we are authenticated.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.770
So we'll do in a wait request over to app.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.350
I'll make a post to API users sign up.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.080
And we'll send off an email that is valid.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.560
And a password.

01:31.840 --> 01:32.980
That is valid as well.

01:33.010 --> 01:38.710
And then once again, we will make sure that we get back a status code of not one but 201.

01:40.730 --> 01:43.580
So again, this is just going to make sure that we are successfully signed up.

01:44.130 --> 01:46.380
So then after that, we'll make our request.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.120
It's going to be a post request to API user sign out.

01:50.420 --> 01:55.250
And again on the response, we should be able to inspect that set cookie header and figure out exactly

01:55.250 --> 01:56.150
what gets sent back.

01:56.150 --> 02:00.440
When we sign out, we'll have to console.log that thing to figure out exactly how we should write that

02:00.440 --> 02:01.130
assertion.

02:02.240 --> 02:07.670
They'll do a concert response is a wait request to app.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.730
We'll do a post in this case to API users.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.680
Sign out in this case.

02:15.370 --> 02:18.790
We're going to send along an empty object because it is a post request.

02:20.750 --> 02:23.870
And then we will expect to get back again a 200.

02:26.100 --> 02:29.380
The 200 is not strictly necessary here or this expectation.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.520
It's really just to say, hey, we completed the request successfully.

02:33.900 --> 02:38.940
Now we need to do a console.log on that response and take a look at exactly what happens to that set

02:38.970 --> 02:41.550
cookie header when we try to clear that session.

02:41.820 --> 02:47.130
So I will do for right now just a console log of response target set cookie.

02:51.340 --> 02:52.480
All right, we'll save this.

02:52.480 --> 02:53.860
Go back over to our terminal.

02:54.860 --> 02:58.580
We've got that new test file inside there and there is our console.log.

02:59.420 --> 03:05.090
So it looks like whenever we try to sign out, we get back an empty session right there.

03:05.090 --> 03:07.070
Or essentially we're setting this to no data.

03:07.070 --> 03:10.670
And the cookie is also set to expire way long ago in the past.

03:11.300 --> 03:16.460
So we could try to just copy this thing right here entirely and say that the set cookie header should

03:16.460 --> 03:17.410
be equal to this.

03:17.420 --> 03:18.800
That'd be one strategy.

03:18.980 --> 03:21.260
So I could really just copy that.

03:21.290 --> 03:22.850
Maybe just that string right there.

03:25.960 --> 03:30.010
And then put in an expectation that looks like expect response.

03:31.220 --> 03:35.460
But get that cookie that gives us back an array, as you just saw.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.590
So it is an array.

03:37.130 --> 03:39.160
So we can take a look at the first entry inside there.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.630
Then we could say that must be equal to.

03:43.450 --> 03:46.600
And then put in that exact string that we saw inside of our terminal.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.710
So again, this would be one approach right here.

03:49.740 --> 03:53.970
Alternatively, we could just say set cookie is defined as we had previously.

03:53.970 --> 03:55.680
That would also be 100% valid.

03:55.890 --> 03:57.000
It's really up to you.

03:57.030 --> 04:00.240
I don't really expect the response right here or the structure to ever change.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.650
I think that it will always look like this forever, so I feel kind of okay using that string.

04:04.650 --> 04:08.880
But again, if you want to have a little bit more generic expectation, you could once again just say,

04:08.880 --> 04:12.240
Oh yeah, that set cookie header is defined, by the way, totally fine.

04:13.400 --> 04:13.730
All right.

04:13.730 --> 04:17.180
I am going to save this and run the test just one time to make sure it works.

04:17.810 --> 04:18.950
Self look back over.

04:20.150 --> 04:20.810
Very good.

04:21.410 --> 04:21.740
All right.

04:21.740 --> 04:23.490
Well, that is it for sign out.

04:23.550 --> 04:27.620
So we're now going to move on, quick pause and then take a look at current user, which is going to

04:27.620 --> 04:29.930
have some new stuff that we're going to have to consider.

04:30.260 --> 04:31.460
I'll see you in just a moment.
