00:01.100 --> 00:03.290
All right, my friends, let's do this refactor.

00:03.290 --> 00:07.700
So we're going to create a new file called JS that is going to be responsible for creating the express

00:07.700 --> 00:11.180
app, wiring together all the middleware, root handlers and so on.

00:11.360 --> 00:15.050
We're then going to make sure we import that into indexed JS, which is where we're going to actually

00:15.050 --> 00:20.180
start up the app, along with all the other associated things that need a connection such as Mongoose

00:20.180 --> 00:21.050
and so on.

00:21.560 --> 00:22.970
So back inside, my editor.

00:23.930 --> 00:25.820
I'm going to find my CRC directory.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.450
And inside there, I'm going to make a new file.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.870
Called App JS or excuse me, not avg's app.

00:34.220 --> 00:34.500
Yes.

00:34.710 --> 00:36.180
We are writing TypeScript.

00:36.210 --> 00:36.930
That's right.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.290
So here is what's right here.

00:40.710 --> 00:45.930
And then going to go back over to index us and we're going to do a big copy paste.

00:46.410 --> 00:49.380
So I'm going to take everything from the very top.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.260
All the way down.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.790
See that start function.

00:55.660 --> 00:57.160
So right above the start function.

00:57.280 --> 01:00.130
So where we currently have app use, we're going to take everything.

01:00.130 --> 01:04.030
I'm going to cut all of it, move it over to apts and paste.

01:07.690 --> 01:11.610
Now, if we go back over to index notes, we will immediately see an air around Mongoose.

01:11.620 --> 01:14.920
So I did pull over one import statement that we should have not pulled.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.510
That is the import for mongoose.

01:16.660 --> 01:17.840
So back inside of APT.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.090
Yes, the new file would just create it.

01:19.090 --> 01:20.790
I'm going to find that import from Mongoose.

01:20.800 --> 01:21.760
I'm going to cut it.

01:22.660 --> 01:24.820
Go back over to index and paste.

01:27.110 --> 01:27.860
That looks good.

01:28.930 --> 01:35.020
So now we need to make sure that we export the app from the app to file and import it into index.

01:36.220 --> 01:38.630
So we'll go back over to app TS.

01:39.910 --> 01:41.230
I'll go down to the very bottom.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.140
And I'll add in an export for our app.

01:45.260 --> 01:48.500
So we'll say export app like so.

01:51.210 --> 01:54.750
Just you know, these curly braces are required because we are doing a named export right here.

01:54.750 --> 01:58.260
We cannot just do just export app by itself.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.600
We have to add in those curly braces.

02:01.850 --> 02:06.500
Now we can go back over to index and at the very top we will import the app.

02:11.820 --> 02:12.840
And that should be it.

02:14.840 --> 02:19.670
I don't see any other errors inside this file and I do not see any errors inside of app either.

02:20.060 --> 02:24.320
So I'm going to save both these files and then I'll go back over to Scaffold running on my terminal

02:24.320 --> 02:26.360
and just make sure that everything's started up correctly.

02:26.990 --> 02:27.470
Yep.

02:27.470 --> 02:28.250
Looks good.

02:30.220 --> 02:30.760
Cool.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.600
So we've now got these two separate files.

02:34.020 --> 02:37.580
We've got our app file that does not start up the express application.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.150
It just configures it.

02:39.870 --> 02:43.740
So now that we've got this initial refactor put together quick files right here, we're going to start

02:43.740 --> 02:44.790
to install.

02:46.870 --> 02:52.930
Super test this MongoDB in-memory copy thing we're gonna install just wire up all this stuff starting

02:52.930 --> 02:53.860
in the next video.
