In this video, we're going to try to write out a test just to make sure that a user cannot sign up

00:05.710 --> 00:07.320
with the same email twice in a row.

00:07.410 --> 00:09.960
So I'm going to go back over to my sign up test file.

00:10.170 --> 00:11.460
I'm down at the very bottom.

00:11.490 --> 00:18.390
I'm going to write out a new IT block and I'll give it a description like it disallows duplicate emails.

00:21.720 --> 00:26.760
Then inside of here we'll attempt to sign up the same email and password combination twice in a row.

00:26.970 --> 00:31.080
The first request we will expect to give us back a response of 201.

00:31.080 --> 00:35.250
Which indicates that the signup was successful, as we did back up here.

00:35.460 --> 00:37.890
Well, then duplicate that request once again.

00:37.890 --> 00:41.160
And on the second request, we'll just expect to get back a 400.

00:41.160 --> 00:45.690
Because remember, if an email is already in use, we throw a bad request error, which is going to

00:45.690 --> 00:49.410
send a 200 or 400 code back to the user.

00:50.420 --> 00:53.330
So inside that new block will do and await.

00:54.300 --> 00:59.400
Request on app will make a post request to API users sign up.

01:02.020 --> 01:08.020
We will send along an email of test at test and a password of password.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.090
And then finally we'll put on an expectation.

01:11.090 --> 01:14.840
So in this case, again, for the first request, signup should be successful.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.520
So we should get back a 201.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.490
Now we can duplicate that.

01:20.340 --> 01:20.940
So copy.

01:20.940 --> 01:21.810
Paste it down.

01:23.300 --> 01:28.490
And then on the second one, all we're going to expect different is a response of 400 or a status code

01:28.490 --> 01:29.330
of 400.

01:29.630 --> 01:31.130
So I'll put in 400 instead.

01:31.880 --> 01:32.870
Let's save that.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.310
Check the terminal.

01:36.010 --> 01:36.820
Here's my test window.

01:36.850 --> 01:37.510
Here it is.

01:38.020 --> 01:38.830
Looks good.

01:40.160 --> 01:40.520
All right.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.740
There are a couple of more tests I'd like to put together very quickly.

01:42.740 --> 01:45.710
So quick pause, one or two more tests in the next video.
