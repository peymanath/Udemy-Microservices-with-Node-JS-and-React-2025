00:00.770 --> 00:04.140
All right, my friends, let's start doing some setup for our tickets service.

00:04.160 --> 00:08.570
So, like I said, we're going to be copy pasting a lot of stuff over from the service, so let's get

00:08.570 --> 00:09.050
to it.

00:09.500 --> 00:13.730
Back inside of my editor, I'm going to find my root project directory and I'll create a new folder

00:13.730 --> 00:15.770
inside there called Simply Tickets.

00:16.930 --> 00:20.350
They're going to zoom in a little bit so you can see what I am about to do very easily.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.140
Inside of tickets, I'm going to expand that thing.

00:23.170 --> 00:24.860
I'm also going to expand off.

00:25.540 --> 00:33.100
Then inside the service I'm going to a multi select config package, JSON package lock, docker file

00:33.100 --> 00:35.020
and the Docker ignore file.

00:36.480 --> 00:41.820
I'm then going to copy all five of those files and I'm going to paste all of them into tickets.

00:45.220 --> 00:48.520
Then inside of tickets, I'm going to make a new directory called CRC.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.570
I'm going to go back up to the service.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.000
I'll expand shark inside of there.

00:55.850 --> 01:03.320
And out of this CRC directory all we want to get is index TZ apts and a test directory.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.900
So I'm going to multi select those three things.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.940
I'm going to copy all of those.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.890
Well, then collapse off.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.580
I'm going to go down to tickets and paste everything inside there.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.480
And that's pretty much it.

01:19.650 --> 01:21.570
We're not going to go through our tickets directory.

01:21.570 --> 01:26.660
We're going to find a couple of places where we still have some references back to the art service.

01:26.670 --> 01:30.780
We're going to make sure that we just replace any words referring to the service with tickets just to

01:30.780 --> 01:31.830
make sure it's really clear.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.800
Oh yeah, this is the package, just on file for tickets and so on.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.290
Okay, let's start off for inside of Docker.

01:37.290 --> 01:38.720
Ignore nothing inside there.

01:38.730 --> 01:40.020
How about the Docker file?

01:40.140 --> 01:42.330
Nothing specific about the inside of here.

01:42.510 --> 01:44.100
How about package JSON?

01:44.430 --> 01:47.640
Well, in the package JSON file, we've got a name of auth.

01:48.030 --> 01:50.370
Let's update that to tickets instead.

01:52.690 --> 01:53.100
Cool.

01:53.860 --> 01:55.830
Then let's go inside the QQ directory.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.810
I'm going to find indexed keys inside of here.

01:58.810 --> 02:00.190
We've got a couple of different errors.

02:00.190 --> 02:04.540
That's just because we have not installed any dependencies into this process, into this project just

02:04.540 --> 02:04.990
yet.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.300
So we'll ignore those errors right now.

02:08.440 --> 02:13.570
It looks like there is a direct connection string right here to connect to our mongo instance.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.070
So we'll have to update that.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.930
Let's just keep that in the back of our head for a moment.

02:18.070 --> 02:20.440
And I don't see it too much other stuff inside there.

02:20.530 --> 02:22.080
How about in the app file?

02:22.510 --> 02:27.640
Inside of here, we've got a lot of references to some routers that do not exist inside of our tickets

02:27.640 --> 02:28.300
project.

02:28.540 --> 02:31.030
So I'm going to delete those right away, just so I don't forget.

02:33.420 --> 02:38.070
I'll then go down to where we had wired those things up to our express application and delete that as

02:38.070 --> 02:38.550
well.

02:40.330 --> 02:45.070
If you see any errors inside of here where I don't, or if you see pretty much anything that appears

02:45.070 --> 02:45.910
to be wrong inside of here.

02:45.940 --> 02:46.700
Don't sweat it.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.230
A lot of errors will go away as soon as we start to install dependencies.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.710
I'm going to close the app to file one last location.

02:54.710 --> 02:57.110
Let's check really quickly inside the test folder.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.860
I'm going to take a look at setup tests.

02:59.970 --> 03:01.230
And so inside of here.

03:01.530 --> 03:05.910
Well, I don't really see too much inside of here that I'm all that worried about.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.220
I do some see some stuff about sign in down here at the bottom that we might have to update.

03:10.220 --> 03:13.400
But for the most part, I think we could probably just leave all this as is.

03:14.360 --> 03:14.660
Okay.

03:14.660 --> 03:16.520
So let's go back over to our terminal.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.970
We're going to install dependencies inside of this tickets folder.

03:20.120 --> 03:26.000
Naturally, we could have copied over the node modules directory itself, but I'm just going to install

03:26.000 --> 03:27.260
dependencies manually.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.310
No reason not to.

03:30.050 --> 03:31.910
So inside of tickets I'll do an NPM install.

03:31.910 --> 03:32.750
Simple enough.

03:34.450 --> 03:34.900
All right.

03:34.900 --> 03:37.750
So, like I said, definitely saved ourselves a lot of time.

03:37.750 --> 03:41.320
That would have been about an hour of writing out all that stuff from scratch if we had to.

03:42.020 --> 03:47.030
So let's finish up this video by building our image and pushing it off to Docker Hub.

03:48.190 --> 03:49.270
So back at my terminal.

03:49.510 --> 03:50.350
Oh, look at that.

03:50.350 --> 03:53.800
We have to wait once again for MongoDB memory to be installed.

03:53.830 --> 03:58.300
Like I said, that's why we added that thing to the development dependencies list so we don't have to

03:58.300 --> 04:02.410
download that thing every single time that we try to redeploy our image.

04:02.920 --> 04:03.130
All right.

04:03.130 --> 04:06.070
So I can open up a second terminal window inside of tickets.

04:07.420 --> 04:07.990
Inside of here.

04:07.990 --> 04:09.190
I'll try to build my image.

04:09.460 --> 04:16.000
So I'm going to do a Docker build T by Docker ID, flash tickets and then a dot.

04:18.570 --> 04:22.890
Doing the installation should only take a moment or so since we've got that only prod flag on there,

04:22.890 --> 04:28.710
which means we do not have to install or download and install that MongoDB memory binary, which means

04:28.710 --> 04:31.350
we're saving 80 megabytes off this install process.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.450
So someone's going to give this a second to finish up.

04:33.450 --> 04:37.260
And once it's all done, like I said, we're going make sure that we push this off to Docker Hub.

04:37.650 --> 04:41.850
And if you're curious why we do this in general, it's because when we try to run scaffold, which is

04:41.850 --> 04:45.540
something we're going to be doing in a little bit, Scaffold is going to try to reach out to Docker

04:45.540 --> 04:48.360
Hub to get an initial copy of this image to pull down.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.320
That's kind of the assumption.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.110
Scaffold assumes that you've already built this image once in the past.

04:52.110 --> 04:55.950
That's why we're going through this separate build image and push to Docker have process.

04:55.950 --> 05:00.630
As a reminder, if you are running your project on Google Cloud, you do not have to do this step.

05:00.630 --> 05:03.000
I probably should mention that before I ran the command, but.

05:04.020 --> 05:04.740
That's life.

05:05.750 --> 05:05.950
Okay.

05:06.020 --> 05:08.990
Looks like we're all built, so I'll do a Docker push.

05:09.920 --> 05:10.760
Even greater.

05:11.970 --> 05:12.690
Tickets.

05:13.260 --> 05:14.820
And that's going to push our image up.

05:15.480 --> 05:15.720
All right.

05:15.720 --> 05:16.740
Well, that's pretty much it.

05:17.130 --> 05:18.840
We're going to take a quick pause right here.

05:18.870 --> 05:20.160
Let's continue the next video.

05:20.160 --> 05:24.240
We're going to start to right out that Kubernetes deployment file and all this other stuff.
