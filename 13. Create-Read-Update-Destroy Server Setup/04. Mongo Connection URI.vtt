WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:01.330
At the very end.

00:01.330 --> 00:06.550
A last video I had opened up the tickets index file and I'd mentioned that we still had a URL right

00:06.550 --> 00:10.090
here to connect to the incorrect MongoDB instance.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.960
So this is definitely really bad.

00:11.980 --> 00:15.670
We've got some code inside of here that could have very easily gone on caught.

00:15.700 --> 00:20.320
We might have accidentally deployed this ticket service into production and had it connect to the wrong

00:20.320 --> 00:21.820
MongoDB database.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.080
Definitely not good.

00:23.470 --> 00:27.160
So let's try to figure out some way to solve this and catch issues like this in the future.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.320
Here's one way we could do it very easily.

00:29.350 --> 00:35.350
You might recall that back inside of our infra directory if we open up our tickets deployment file.

00:36.200 --> 00:41.070
When we define this pod spec right here, we have the ability to define some different environment variables.

00:41.090 --> 00:46.370
I think that one easy way to solve this issue potentially in the future would be to add in the URL to

00:46.370 --> 00:48.470
connect to as an environment variable.

00:49.210 --> 00:50.710
So let's try doing that right now.

00:50.830 --> 00:56.380
We're going to make this change both to our ticket service and to the authentication one as well, because

00:56.380 --> 00:59.170
the authentication service is also doing the same thing.

00:59.170 --> 01:01.210
It's got a hard coded URL right there.

01:02.030 --> 01:06.290
We're going to first start with the ticket stuff, so make sure you are inside of the tickets deployment

01:06.290 --> 01:11.880
file and make sure you have open the indexed file inside of the tickets directory.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.900
Make sure you're not changing the wrong files right now.

01:15.960 --> 01:16.160
Okay.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.330
So inside of the tickets deployment file.

01:19.060 --> 01:20.910
I'm going to find the EMV section.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.230
We're going to add in a new environment variable right here.

01:23.560 --> 01:28.420
I'm going to add in a new variable with the name of Mongo underscore Uri.

01:29.580 --> 01:32.610
And then I'm going to set its value directly right here.

01:32.610 --> 01:33.840
So I'm going to put in value.

01:34.350 --> 01:37.470
I'm going to go back over to my ticket's indexed file.

01:38.420 --> 01:40.340
I'm going to find that URL right there.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.170
I'm going to cut it.

01:43.810 --> 01:47.200
I'll then go back over to the deployment file and paste in that string.

01:48.530 --> 01:52.970
Now this string is still referencing the authentication MongoDB instance.

01:52.970 --> 01:57.740
So let's update that and make sure we are connecting to the tickets, one that we just created the deployment

01:57.740 --> 01:59.030
file for a moment ago.

01:59.630 --> 02:05.120
If you need a reminder inside of our tickets, MongoDB or Mongo double file, we can take a look at

02:05.120 --> 02:06.800
the name of the service at the bottom.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.380
The name of the service is tickets, Mongo CRV.

02:09.380 --> 02:15.740
That is what we are trying to connect to so we can find off Mongo XLV and update it to tickets.

02:16.810 --> 02:22.150
And then remember inside of a MongoDB database, there can technically be multiple different databases.

02:22.390 --> 02:25.400
That's what the name right here at the very end is referring to.

02:25.420 --> 02:28.900
That's the name of the database inside of this database that we're trying to create.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.530
So we're going to update that to tickets not strictly required.

02:32.530 --> 02:37.300
We can have a database name of anything we want, but I found it's usually best to just put some consistent

02:37.300 --> 02:38.140
name inside there.

02:39.530 --> 02:43.970
Now one thing I want to mention is that we have now hardcoded a connection URL inside of a deployment

02:43.970 --> 02:44.540
file.

02:44.570 --> 02:50.300
If we were to commit this file right now to get and then say push it up to GitHub, anyone in the world

02:50.300 --> 02:52.340
would be able to see this URL right here.

02:52.580 --> 02:53.750
Is that a problem?

02:54.050 --> 02:56.060
I would really strongly argue.

02:56.060 --> 02:56.550
No.

02:56.570 --> 02:57.920
It is not an issue.

02:57.950 --> 02:59.630
Although there is a URL right here.

02:59.630 --> 03:03.320
This URL is only accessible if someone is inside of our cluster.

03:03.350 --> 03:08.330
The only reason I would be concerned about putting my URL right here as a plain string out online is

03:08.330 --> 03:15.110
if there was a username and password associated or required to log in or connect to this MongoDB instance.

03:15.380 --> 03:20.930
If there was a username and password required, I would definitely not want to write it out right here

03:20.930 --> 03:21.950
as plain text.

03:22.280 --> 03:27.560
But as long as we are just connecting to some plain URL without any security around it, and as long

03:27.560 --> 03:33.620
as we also have this deployment file that very plainly spells out exactly how to connect to this thing,

03:33.740 --> 03:38.360
I again, I'm going to strongly argue and say, no, it's really not an issue to put this thing right

03:38.360 --> 03:39.500
here as a plain string.

03:40.040 --> 03:45.590
If we did care about that, if we had a username and password authentication scheme with MongoDB, then

03:45.590 --> 03:50.750
all we'd have to do is define this environment variable inside of a secret, just as we did with the

03:50.750 --> 03:52.100
JSON web token key.

03:54.570 --> 03:57.150
So that should be it, at least for the deployment file.

03:57.450 --> 04:00.870
So I'm going to save the ticket's deployment file and close it.

04:02.230 --> 04:05.290
I'm now left inside of my ticket's indexed file.

04:05.710 --> 04:10.780
So inside of here, we need to make sure that we try to connect to the MongoDB instance with the URI

04:10.810 --> 04:12.940
that is provided inside that environment variable.

04:13.590 --> 04:17.580
You might recall that before we can access any environment variable, we do have to make sure that it

04:17.580 --> 04:18.540
actually is defined.

04:18.540 --> 04:21.270
Otherwise TypeScript is going to get really unhappy with us.

04:21.570 --> 04:24.190
So I'm going to do another very similar check to what we did before.

04:24.210 --> 04:30.210
I'm going to say if not process EMV Mongo URI.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.310
Now let's throw a new air.

04:33.410 --> 04:37.370
And I'll say Mongo, you or I must be defined.

04:38.820 --> 04:44.340
And then we can pass the environment variable in as the first argument to Mongoose connect the process

04:44.550 --> 04:46.410
of Mongo.

04:47.220 --> 04:47.940
You're right.

04:50.900 --> 04:51.530
All right.

04:52.830 --> 04:53.880
So let's save this.

04:55.510 --> 04:59.710
I'm going to go back over to my terminal and I just want to take a look at scaffold and make sure that

04:59.710 --> 05:01.320
everything booted up just fine.

05:01.330 --> 05:01.750
Yep.

05:01.750 --> 05:02.920
Looks like it definitely did.

05:03.460 --> 05:08.500
Now to test this and make sure that we actually are connecting to Mongo through that environment variable,

05:08.530 --> 05:14.470
I could go back over to the deployment file for tickets I could find where we just defined that environment

05:14.470 --> 05:16.180
variable and comment that out.

05:16.840 --> 05:22.780
If I then save this file scaffold should update the deployment that will cause our pod to be recreated

05:22.780 --> 05:24.160
without the environment variable.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.770
And then we should see an error at our terminal.

05:27.190 --> 05:32.530
And before I save this and confirm that everything is working as expected, I want you to know I have

05:32.530 --> 05:38.110
noticed some really strange inconsistencies with setting environment variables and then changing them

05:38.110 --> 05:39.100
or removing them.

05:39.280 --> 05:43.960
So if I do not immediately see an error, I'm not going to be super concerned right away.

05:43.990 --> 05:49.420
We should see an error, but if I don't, I might be able to solve the issue by just restarting scaffold.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.210
Long story short, let's just save this and see what happens.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.200
So I'll save the file.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.190
I'm going to flip back over.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.680
I'll see that the deployment was configured.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.320
Then we should see a new pod being created.

05:59.320 --> 06:03.760
I know this is a new pod because it has a different ID than the previous one running our tickets pod.

06:04.150 --> 06:05.230
And now in this scenario.

06:05.230 --> 06:08.620
Yeah, it looks like it's not quite working as expected here.

06:08.620 --> 06:11.200
I should not have been able to connect to MongoDB.

06:11.230 --> 06:15.160
I should have gotten an error saying that Mongo URI is not defined.

06:15.610 --> 06:20.650
One way to try to fix this, I can go back over to the index file and I'm going to try to just hard

06:20.650 --> 06:22.900
save this file again so I can hit command s.

06:23.740 --> 06:28.540
Scaffold is going to think that the file was just updated and it should try to sync the file, which

06:28.540 --> 06:30.820
should cause node to restart my server.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.020
So I'll flip back over.

06:32.020 --> 06:35.170
And now it looks like yeah, it did work right here.

06:35.170 --> 06:41.050
So I see that error but also looks like for some reason my server also started back up successfully

06:41.050 --> 06:41.890
anyways.

06:41.890 --> 06:46.420
So again I have noticed some weirdness around doing these environment variable checks.

06:47.350 --> 06:50.890
It only seems to be occurring once you start to initially make that change.

06:50.890 --> 06:54.520
But the next time you restart scaffold, usually it seems like the issue goes away.

06:54.520 --> 06:58.600
Just to prove that I'm going to stop scaffold, everything gets deleted.

06:59.380 --> 07:02.770
I'm going to wait for everything to actually be terminated.

07:06.150 --> 07:08.880
And for some reason, it always seems to take a little bit too long.

07:08.910 --> 07:09.600
Here we go.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.190
I'll start it back up.

07:14.340 --> 07:19.260
And now when my ticket service starts back up, all this environment variable stuff should be fixed,

07:19.260 --> 07:22.860
so I should see an air start to appear right away if it is not defined.

07:23.430 --> 07:24.150
And there we go.

07:24.150 --> 07:25.050
There's the big error.

07:25.440 --> 07:32.070
Mongo uri must be defined and I just keep getting that air and air again because scaffold keeps on trying

07:32.070 --> 07:33.420
to restart my pod.

07:33.630 --> 07:37.560
Or to be more precise, the deployment does and I just keep throwing the same air over and over.

07:38.670 --> 07:43.830
So this is definitely a good improvement for making sure that we capture and just recognize that, oh

07:43.830 --> 07:48.690
yeah, we need to update this MongoDB, you or I, any time that we start to copy paste this stuff over

07:48.690 --> 07:49.740
to another service.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.450
So last step, I'm going to uncomment that.

07:51.450 --> 07:52.590
I'm going to save the file.

07:53.420 --> 07:54.590
I'll go back over to my terminal.

07:54.590 --> 07:57.710
And now I should be back to seeing everything working correctly.

07:57.980 --> 07:58.550
Very good.

07:59.770 --> 08:00.930
All right, quick pause right here.

08:00.940 --> 08:04.120
We're then going to go over to our service and do the exact same thing.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.040
We're going to set up an environment variable.

08:06.490 --> 08:10.600
We're going to reference that environment variable inside of our index file, all inside of auth.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.100
That'll be really quick, I promise.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.900
So let's take care of it in just a moment.
