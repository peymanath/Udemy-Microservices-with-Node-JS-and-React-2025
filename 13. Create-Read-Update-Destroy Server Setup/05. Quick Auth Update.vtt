00:00.710 --> 00:02.540
As I mentioned at the end of last video.

00:02.540 --> 00:05.180
Let's go over to our service really quickly.

00:05.300 --> 00:08.570
Inside the CRC directory, I will find the indexed file.

00:09.020 --> 00:13.430
So rather than having a hardcoded URL right here, let's instead move that over to the deployment file

00:13.430 --> 00:15.410
and set it up as an environment variable.

00:16.130 --> 00:17.690
So I'm going to take that string right there.

00:17.690 --> 00:18.560
I'm going to cut it.

00:19.710 --> 00:22.230
I'll then go and find my off deployment file.

00:23.370 --> 00:24.590
Here's the deployment file.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.140
I'll find the EMV section.

00:26.160 --> 00:33.030
I'll add in a new environment variable with the name of Mongo Uri and then set the value like so.

00:34.950 --> 00:39.480
We are inside the deployment file, so I'm going to triple check and make sure I've got off.

00:39.960 --> 00:40.620
Off.

00:42.130 --> 00:43.210
I'll then save this.

00:43.940 --> 00:48.230
And I will go back over to the index file again inside of the service.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.760
Now let's do the same thing we just did over inside of tickets.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.500
So I'll say if not process and v mongo uri.

00:57.450 --> 00:58.500
Your new air.

01:00.110 --> 01:00.330
Mango.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.680
Your eye must be defined.

01:04.750 --> 01:08.770
And then I will reference that as the first argument to connect the process.

01:08.770 --> 01:11.140
E and v mongo uri.

01:13.410 --> 01:14.220
I'll save.

01:14.550 --> 01:16.920
And then finally, let's just make sure this is still working.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.270
So I'll flip back over to my terminal.

01:18.570 --> 01:23.040
Looks like the deployment was restarted, so hopefully we are connecting to MongoDB.

01:23.430 --> 01:28.290
Now if you see an error here, remember there is some weirdness for some reason when we start to change

01:28.290 --> 01:29.430
environment variables.

01:29.430 --> 01:33.810
So if you see some kind of error and you're really sure you wrote everything correctly, I would encourage

01:33.810 --> 01:35.220
you to restart scaffold.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.340
All right, so that should be it.

01:38.630 --> 01:39.080
Okay.

01:39.290 --> 01:41.770
So we've got some good setup, complete with tickets.

01:41.780 --> 01:42.950
Let's take a pause right here.

01:42.950 --> 01:46.940
We're going to start writing out some route handlers, some tests and so on in the next video.
