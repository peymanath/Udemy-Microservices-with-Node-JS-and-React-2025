WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:03.240
We've built our image and pushed it off to Docker Hub.

00:03.240 --> 00:07.560
Again, only required if you're running Docker on your local machine, not if you're running Docker

00:07.560 --> 00:09.360
or Kubernetes on Google Cloud.

00:09.870 --> 00:10.530
Let's move on.

00:10.530 --> 00:15.030
We're going to start to write out our Kubernetes file for the deployment and service to run our test

00:15.030 --> 00:15.750
service.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.920
Back inside, my editor, I'm going to find my infra directory.

00:20.710 --> 00:22.200
Inside the folder.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.780
I'll make a new file called Tickets Double HTML.

00:27.990 --> 00:33.000
Now inside of here, we're going to write out a very familiar looking deployment and service config.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.280
So once again, rather than doing all this from scratch, let's just do a copy paste from our off deployment.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.180
It really is going to be completely identical, except wherever we have the word auth, we're going

00:42.180 --> 00:43.830
to replace it with the word tickets.

00:44.370 --> 00:46.440
So I will open up the auth deployment file.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.940
I'm going to copy the contents.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.720
I'll then go over to the newly created tickets double file.

00:52.050 --> 00:53.100
I'm going to paste this in.

00:54.460 --> 00:56.950
And I'll go through here every single place I see.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.930
I will replace it with tickets.

00:59.170 --> 01:00.700
So I'm going to do one.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.560
To.

01:03.540 --> 01:04.200
Three.

01:06.020 --> 01:06.710
Or.

01:08.540 --> 01:09.350
And five.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.910
So five in the deployment section.

01:11.910 --> 01:13.860
Make sure you have updated all of those as well.

01:14.100 --> 01:18.800
You'll notice that inside of here we've still got a reference to that environment variable of JWT.

01:19.050 --> 01:20.940
Do we need this for the ticket service?

01:20.970 --> 01:22.590
Yes, absolutely.

01:22.590 --> 01:27.070
Because our ticket service, remember, it's going to try to handle authentication by itself.

01:27.090 --> 01:31.710
The ticket service is going to need to decide whether or not a request includes a valid JSON web token.

01:31.710 --> 01:36.000
And we can only validate a token if we have the original key that we created the token with.

01:36.030 --> 01:39.270
So our ticket service definitely needs the JSON web token key.

01:40.300 --> 01:40.570
Okay.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.440
Now that we've done those five updates up here, let's go down to the service itself.

01:44.470 --> 01:48.550
So here's the cluster IP service and we will update one.

01:50.330 --> 01:50.990
To.

01:52.200 --> 01:52.770
Three.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.130
Once I've got that all done, I'll save this file.

01:59.130 --> 01:59.510
All right.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.510
So that's pretty much it.

02:00.930 --> 02:03.590
We are done with writing out that Kubernetes deployment file.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.370
We're now going to move on to updating our scaffold YAML file.

02:06.390 --> 02:09.030
Again, this is all about setting up that file sinking.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.550
I'll find the scaffold yaml file.

02:14.540 --> 02:15.950
I'm going to go down to the bottom.

02:17.400 --> 02:22.180
Let's find out about the art section right here really is our template, to be honest with you.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.340
I'm going to copy that.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.190
And then paste it down at the very bottom.

02:27.790 --> 02:29.410
I'll fix up some indentation.

02:32.730 --> 02:35.550
And then I'm going to update off over two tickets.

02:42.390 --> 02:46.680
It looks like the source right here can stay the same because we still want to sync everything inside

02:46.680 --> 02:48.000
that CRC directory.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.030
So that should pretty much be it for the scaffold yaml file.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.010
I will save this.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.690
Now, the very last thing we have to do, let's make sure that we write out the Kubernetes file for

02:58.690 --> 03:02.650
the MongoDB deployment and the cluster IP service for it as well.

03:02.890 --> 03:03.820
And guess what?

03:03.820 --> 03:07.540
Do you think we're going to be able to copy the authentication Mongo deployment?

03:07.630 --> 03:09.530
Yes, absolutely we can.

03:09.550 --> 03:11.470
It's going to be 100% identical.

03:12.330 --> 03:17.670
So inside the cage directory I'll make a new file called tickets mongo devel html.

03:19.910 --> 03:22.690
I will open up the Mongo deployment file.

03:22.700 --> 03:27.020
I'm going to copy everything inside of here, then go back over to the tickets mongo deployment file

03:27.020 --> 03:27.920
we just created.

03:28.460 --> 03:33.050
I'll paste everything inside and then once again, anywhere we see the word auth, we will replace it

03:33.050 --> 03:33.980
with tickets.

03:34.430 --> 03:36.350
So I will do one.

03:37.200 --> 03:37.890
To.

03:39.020 --> 03:39.680
Three.

03:40.730 --> 03:41.290
For.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.470
Make sure you've got for updates.

03:46.280 --> 03:51.860
I'll then go down to my cluster IP service and I'm going to do update one.

03:52.870 --> 03:53.740
And to.

03:56.920 --> 03:57.340
Okay.

03:57.790 --> 03:59.980
Let's save this and close it out.

04:00.720 --> 04:01.500
Well, that is it.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.640
That is how we would normally create a new service.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.580
Well, almost exactly how we do it.

04:05.610 --> 04:11.130
Obviously, we might not want to do that copy paste of another service because who knows what dependencies

04:11.130 --> 04:15.960
we might be pulling over that we don't actually want or some config or who knows what else.

04:16.050 --> 04:19.020
But at least inside this course, that's how we're going to create a new service.

04:19.260 --> 04:23.220
The last thing I'm going to do is make sure that I can get scaffold up and running successfully.

04:23.310 --> 04:24.930
So I'm going to go back over to my terminal.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.210
I'm going to find the terminal window running scaffold.

04:27.240 --> 04:30.090
I would recommend you shut scaffold down entirely.

04:30.690 --> 04:36.000
And then after closing it, do a little get pods and make sure that all the different pods actually

04:36.000 --> 04:37.080
do get terminated.

04:37.710 --> 04:43.020
It might take a moment or two so we can run the command a couple of times and eventually.

04:43.020 --> 04:43.710
There we go.

04:43.710 --> 04:44.520
They're all dead.

04:45.150 --> 04:48.630
So I'll then start my scaffold back up with Scaffold Dev.

04:49.020 --> 04:49.940
Now a quick note.

04:49.950 --> 04:52.500
You might see an air start to appear.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.070
It might be a big red air.

04:54.090 --> 04:59.490
It might say something like Cannot pull image or can't find image your dock or ID slash tickets.

04:59.490 --> 05:02.550
If you see an air like that, here's what you should do.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.770
Go back over to your tickets directory.

05:05.580 --> 05:13.710
Rebuild the image manually so inside of tickets rerun that docker build dash t your docker ID tickets

05:13.710 --> 05:14.340
dot.

05:15.230 --> 05:16.100
Run that.

05:17.170 --> 05:18.190
Do another doctor.

05:18.190 --> 05:18.850
Push.

05:23.050 --> 05:28.390
And then after the push is complete, restart scaffold again and hopefully after that the air should

05:28.390 --> 05:29.410
be going away.

05:29.740 --> 05:30.680
So go ahead, give that a shot.

05:30.700 --> 05:35.140
Hopefully everything gets up and running and at some point inside this log, there's a lot of information

05:35.140 --> 05:35.530
inside of it.

05:35.530 --> 05:40.180
Now, we should see something that says tickets to people connected to MongoDB and listening on Port

05:40.180 --> 05:40.990
3000.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.790
Well, it looks good for me.

05:43.680 --> 05:47.040
I do want you to recall we are connecting to MongoDB inside of here.

05:47.040 --> 05:52.480
But remember right now we are connecting to the wrong instance of MongoDB inside of tickets.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.990
If we go back over to our editor, find tickets.

05:55.930 --> 05:56.680
index.HTML.

05:57.880 --> 05:58.430
Remember?

05:58.450 --> 05:59.890
Wrong url right there.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.600
So we need to make sure that we fix that thing up.

06:02.380 --> 06:03.180
Quick pause right here.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.780
Let's continue in just a moment.
