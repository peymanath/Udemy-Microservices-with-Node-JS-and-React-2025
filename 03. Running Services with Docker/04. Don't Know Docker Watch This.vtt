00:01.530 --> 00:04.690
In the last two videos, we spoke about Docker and Kubernetes.

00:04.710 --> 00:08.950
Now, at this point time, I don't know if you're taking this course with background knowledge of Docker.

00:08.970 --> 00:12.360
In other words, if you're taking this course, I don't really want to assume that you know about anything

00:12.360 --> 00:13.020
about Docker.

00:13.020 --> 00:17.460
But I'm also kind of assuming that if you're here taking a course about microservices, maybe you know

00:17.460 --> 00:18.630
something about Docker.

00:18.660 --> 00:19.490
I don't know.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.900
The point is, I don't really know what your skill level is.

00:22.110 --> 00:25.290
So to accommodate for that, here's what we're going to do inside this course.

00:25.530 --> 00:30.630
If you do not know anything about Docker or if you just need a quick refresher on it, no problem.

00:30.810 --> 00:32.310
There is appendix section.

00:32.310 --> 00:33.750
So a section of videos.

00:33.750 --> 00:38.250
Towards the end of the course, they're going to walk you through installing Docker and teach you about

00:38.250 --> 00:40.320
some of the basics around Docker as well.

00:40.650 --> 00:44.790
So if you don't know anything about it or if you just need a quick refresher, then stop this video

00:44.790 --> 00:45.420
right now.

00:45.420 --> 00:49.830
Go to that appendix section and find the collection of videos over there that will teach you about the

00:49.830 --> 00:50.880
basics of Docker.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.420
Once you get through all that stuff, come back here and we'll continue on.

00:55.410 --> 00:57.240
Same thing kind of applies to Kubernetes.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.870
I don't really know if you're familiar with Kubernetes as you're taking this course or not.

01:00.960 --> 01:04.770
So we're just going to say that if you don't know anything about Kubernetes, we're going to walk through

01:04.770 --> 01:05.760
some of the basics.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.660
We're going to go through the basics of Kubernetes and the following coming videos rather than going

01:09.660 --> 01:11.820
through it in appendix section, however.

01:11.970 --> 01:14.160
So if you don't know anything about Kubernetes, no problem.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.530
Just stay tuned and we'll go through it together as well.
