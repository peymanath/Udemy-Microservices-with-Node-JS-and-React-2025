WEBVTT

00:01.060 --> 00:02.590
Bye project has started back up.

00:02.590 --> 00:06.520
I don't see any distinct errors inside of here or anything like that, so I'm going to go back over

00:06.520 --> 00:08.380
to my browser and do a quick test.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.440
I still have my original window open at ticketing Dev.

00:12.470 --> 00:14.510
Remember, that's how we access our application.

00:14.750 --> 00:19.040
So I'm going to refresh this and I should still see content up here.

00:19.070 --> 00:19.820
Looks good.

00:21.180 --> 00:21.420
All right.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.910
So that definitely means that everything is working as expected.

00:24.090 --> 00:28.290
Now, at this point, I would like to very quickly show you how we can very easily make a change to

00:28.290 --> 00:33.450
something inside of our common module and then reflect those changes inside of our project.

00:34.200 --> 00:39.850
So let's imagine that we need to make a change to the common module, maybe inside the index file.

00:39.870 --> 00:40.500
Maybe.

00:40.500 --> 00:40.920
I don't know.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.110
We need to add just a simple comment at the top.

00:43.470 --> 00:47.250
I'll put in a comment up here that says something like re-export.

00:49.210 --> 00:53.230
Stuff from eres and middle wears.

00:53.410 --> 00:54.310
Simple enough.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.920
So now if we wanted to get this change reflected or this update over to our auth project, here's what

00:59.920 --> 01:00.520
we would do.

01:00.670 --> 01:01.990
We'd save these changes.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.030
We would go back over to our terminal.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.740
We would change into our directory or something.

01:07.780 --> 01:09.040
Not off, but common.

01:09.610 --> 01:10.900
We eventually want to be enough.

01:10.930 --> 01:12.490
Right now we want to be inside a common.

01:12.910 --> 01:15.550
So we're going to rebuild and publish our project.

01:15.730 --> 01:20.320
Recall that we put together a little script to automate that entire process for a real project.

01:20.320 --> 01:24.220
We don't really want to have that script, but again or this course, it's going to save us a decent

01:24.220 --> 01:25.000
amount of time.

01:25.570 --> 01:27.900
So I'll do an NPM run pub.

01:28.940 --> 01:32.540
That'll do the commit, the version, the build, and then the publish.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.910
And there we go.

01:37.210 --> 01:39.730
So I'm up to version 1.09.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.670
Chances are you're not at version 1.9.

01:42.700 --> 01:47.410
I had to record some of the videos before this several times to get everything kind of working just

01:47.410 --> 01:50.290
right, and that's why I've got this higher version number here.

01:50.880 --> 01:53.120
So latest version is 1.9.

01:53.130 --> 01:57.570
We need to make sure that our auth project now uses version 1.9 as well.

01:58.380 --> 02:00.410
So we'll change over to auth.

02:02.370 --> 02:05.460
And then all we really have to do is an NPM update.

02:07.430 --> 02:12.650
SG tickets slash comment and of course you'll replace SG tickets with your organisation name.

02:13.700 --> 02:14.630
So I'll run that.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.120
And very quickly, we will see.

02:19.630 --> 02:20.260
There we go.

02:20.260 --> 02:21.790
Version 1.09.

02:22.700 --> 02:25.850
Now that makes a change as usual to our package chase on file.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.810
So if we go back over to Scaffold, we're going to see that our image is being rebuilt.

02:30.840 --> 02:34.620
We're going to be installing all of our dependencies again, which means that we should be getting at

02:34.640 --> 02:37.550
the latest version of that common module.

02:39.370 --> 02:43.150
Now I'm going to let this just do its thing here really quick, just so I can verify that this actually

02:43.150 --> 02:43.900
all occurred.

02:45.010 --> 02:45.970
Actually, no reason.

02:45.970 --> 02:47.470
Well, okay, there it goes.

02:48.190 --> 02:50.020
It always seems like sometimes it takes forever.

02:50.020 --> 02:51.580
Sometimes it doesn't take any time.

02:51.940 --> 02:52.870
Okay, simple enough.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.310
Looks like everything's restarting.

02:54.310 --> 02:58.930
But how do we actually know that our container is running the correct version of that dependency?

02:59.230 --> 03:04.150
Well, we could actually kind of go into the container and just verify that everything worked as expected.

03:04.630 --> 03:07.720
Let me show you how I can open up another terminal window.

03:08.050 --> 03:10.480
I'm going to do a little get pods.

03:10.990 --> 03:17.020
I'm going to find the pod running our authentication project, and I'm going to try to start up a shell

03:17.020 --> 03:18.520
inside of that pod.

03:18.550 --> 03:22.720
So we're going to access the container inside there and try to take a look at some of the different

03:22.720 --> 03:27.760
files inside of that container directly just to make sure we're running the latest version of our common

03:27.760 --> 03:28.450
project.

03:28.930 --> 03:34.690
So I'm going to copy that pod name and do a CTL exec dash it, then the pod name.

03:34.690 --> 03:36.610
And then at the very end.

03:38.530 --> 03:41.110
So I've now got a shell running inside of that container.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.860
There's the node modules directory inside of there.

03:44.870 --> 03:47.800
So I want to try to open up that node modules folder.

03:47.810 --> 03:53.750
I want to find our common module inside there and I just want to print out the package JSON file and

03:53.750 --> 03:56.720
make sure that we got version 1.9 side there.

03:56.990 --> 03:59.180
So I will change into node modules.

03:59.870 --> 04:05.420
I'll then change into my organization inside there, which is SG tickets.

04:05.420 --> 04:07.910
Again, you'll need to update that organization name.

04:08.890 --> 04:11.110
Inside of there is the common folder.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.200
There's the package on file.

04:14.200 --> 04:19.200
And something is kind of interesting that you'll notice when we install this thing as a dependency,

04:19.210 --> 04:21.700
we didn't get the Z folder or anything like that.

04:21.700 --> 04:25.720
All we got was the build directory and all the files inside there because remember we had set up that

04:25.720 --> 04:29.710
files property inside of our common modules packages on file.

04:30.370 --> 04:35.290
So now I will cat the package JSON file just to print out all the information inside there.

04:36.540 --> 04:39.600
And if I scroll up a little bit, I should be able to verify.

04:41.390 --> 04:44.060
That I've got version 1.09.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.140
Does that means that my container is running the correct version of this module?

04:48.350 --> 04:50.390
The updated version 1.9 right there.

04:51.220 --> 04:51.490
Okay.

04:51.490 --> 04:52.120
So that's it.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.330
That's how we do an update.

04:53.350 --> 04:56.830
Now, of course, you don't actually have to go through the process of verifying that package.

04:56.890 --> 04:57.730
It's on file.

04:57.760 --> 05:02.620
All we really have to do is run some changes inside of our common module.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.170
We're going to run that NPM run pub command.

05:05.290 --> 05:10.870
We'll do an NPM update inside of our project, and that's pretty much it.

05:10.870 --> 05:11.830
That's all we have to do.

05:12.940 --> 05:13.910
So it looks pretty good.

05:13.930 --> 05:15.350
We've got this common module.

05:15.350 --> 05:20.200
What's going to make it really easy to create some additional services in the future, such as the ticketing

05:20.200 --> 05:25.000
one that we're going to start here in just a second and any time we need to make changes to this thing,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.470
well, we've got a strategy for it.

05:26.860 --> 05:27.190
All right.

05:27.190 --> 05:28.240
Enough with lecturing for me.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.500
I'm kind of rattling on now.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.730
So pause right here.

05:30.730 --> 05:34.660
Let's kick off our ticketing service in the next video.
