00:00.690 --> 00:05.010
In the last video, we established that we're going to share all of our code through an NPM package.

00:05.100 --> 00:09.480
And the first thing I want to discuss around publishing our common library as an NPM package is the

00:09.480 --> 00:11.220
security of our code.

00:11.640 --> 00:15.240
So inside of our common library, we're going to have some really common middleware.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.130
So you're going to see all over online, such as that require authentication, middleware and that error

00:20.130 --> 00:21.390
handling stuff and so on.

00:21.750 --> 00:25.890
But inside of your own personal project that you might be working on in the future, your common library

00:25.890 --> 00:28.140
might have some very sensitive code inside of it.

00:28.140 --> 00:31.710
It might contain some very sensitive business logic or something similar.

00:31.980 --> 00:37.140
And so before even creating this package, I just want to have a quick discussion on package security.

00:37.960 --> 00:43.570
When we published a package with AMPM, there are really three different options or three very popular

00:43.570 --> 00:49.120
options, I should say, available to us to make this package available to other people inside of our

00:49.120 --> 00:51.750
company or other people who are working on our project.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.360
We can publish this package to the NPM public registry.

00:55.840 --> 01:01.540
We can publish it to the public registry inside of an organization, or we can publish it to a private

01:01.540 --> 01:02.350
registry.

01:03.570 --> 01:06.420
When we published a package directly to the public registry.

01:06.420 --> 01:11.370
Anyone else can see this package by default, and so anyone else can take a look at your code and possibly

01:11.370 --> 01:13.230
see your business logic inside their.

01:14.030 --> 01:20.120
If you instead publish your package to a organization, we can mark the organization as public or assuming

01:20.150 --> 01:21.050
it has private.

01:21.050 --> 01:25.910
And then only people who are a member of this organization can see the packages inside.

01:26.420 --> 01:31.140
If you want to use a private organization, you do have to pay extra money to NPM.

01:32.620 --> 01:37.510
You can also create a private registry and access to this will be limited to whoever you give direct

01:37.510 --> 01:38.410
access to.

01:39.190 --> 01:43.660
If you try to create a private registry directly through NPM, you end up having to pay money.

01:43.690 --> 01:49.540
Alternatively, you can also host your own open source version of a MPM registry which is free but requires

01:49.540 --> 01:50.890
a bit of additional setup.

01:51.430 --> 01:56.890
So in total, if we just publish this package directly to NPM, it will be public and visible to all.

01:57.280 --> 02:02.200
If we publish it inside of a private organisation, it will be only accessible by people who are a member

02:02.200 --> 02:03.460
of our organisation.

02:03.970 --> 02:08.410
And if we publish it to a private registry, then only people who have access to our registry will be

02:08.410 --> 02:09.100
able to see it.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.400
We're going to end up going with the organization option.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.540
So we're going to create a new organization and then publish our package inside there.

02:16.840 --> 02:20.550
And just, you know, there are public and private organizations.

02:20.560 --> 02:25.030
If you create a public organization, then everyone else is going to be able to see the package inside

02:25.030 --> 02:25.480
of here.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.080
It's only when we create a private one that the package will be hidden.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.650
Creating a public organization does cost money.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.720
So we're not going to create a private one.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.160
We're going to create a public one.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.520
But you could very easily turn it into private if you wish to do so.

02:40.230 --> 02:42.750
Let's first get started by creating this organization.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.500
To do so, I'm going to open up a new browser tab and navigate to NPM.

02:48.850 --> 02:52.270
Once over here, I'm going to make sure that I've signed up for an account.

02:52.870 --> 02:57.550
I'll click on myself on the top right hand side and I'll click on Add organization.

02:58.300 --> 03:04.480
I then get prompted to create a new organization, as you can see right away, that we can create either

03:04.480 --> 03:06.600
a private one or a public one.

03:06.610 --> 03:08.920
And if you want a private one, you've got to pay some money.

03:08.920 --> 03:12.880
So we're not going to go with the private one because honestly, there's not really a lot of secure

03:12.880 --> 03:15.100
or sensitive code inside of our common module.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.340
Let's type in a name for our custom organization.

03:20.220 --> 03:23.460
I'm going to use a name of SG tickets.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.980
So that's going to be the name of my organization.

03:26.280 --> 03:32.110
All organization names created on NPM must be unique, so you will not be able to use SG tickets.

03:32.130 --> 03:35.340
You're going to have to come up with your own name for your organization.

03:35.550 --> 03:37.530
Just make sure it's something you can easily remember.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.370
Just, you know, I use SG because those are my initials, Steven Grider.

03:42.370 --> 03:43.930
After that, I'll click on Create.

03:45.170 --> 03:47.330
I then get prompted to invite some people.

03:47.330 --> 03:52.550
So if I had marked this organisation as private, I would have to invite other people in order for them

03:52.550 --> 03:55.670
to see these packages and install them into their own projects.

03:56.180 --> 04:00.800
In this case, I don't have anyone else to invite, so I'll just click on Skip and that's it.

04:01.730 --> 04:07.040
So now we can create our own packages and push them to this organization.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.320
And if we had marked this organization as private.

04:10.340 --> 04:10.980
That'd be great.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.080
No one else would be able to see these.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.390
But again, I don't really want to pay any money for this.

04:15.080 --> 04:15.380
All right.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.070
So now that we've created this organization, let's take a pause right here in the next video, we're

04:19.070 --> 04:25.470
going to actually create our common module and make sure that we publish it to this private or this

04:25.490 --> 04:26.960
public organization.
