WEBVTT

00:00.710 --> 00:05.420
Now that we've created this organization, we are going to create our shared common library and then

00:05.420 --> 00:09.080
immediately try to publish it to this organization that we just created.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.690
To get started, I'm going to go back over to my terminal.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.090
I'm inside of my ticketing directory.

00:15.120 --> 00:15.720
Inside of here.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.730
I'm going to make a new folder called Common.

00:17.730 --> 00:22.440
So this is where we're going to place all of our common logic that we want to have access to between

00:22.440 --> 00:23.550
our different services.

00:24.030 --> 00:29.730
I'll change into Common and then I'm going to generate a package JSON file inside there with npm init.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.540
Why?

00:32.800 --> 00:37.600
And then going to go over to my code editor and make a couple of changes to that package JSON file.

00:40.170 --> 00:44.090
Now there's a lot of settings inside of here that you might have ignored over time.

00:44.100 --> 00:49.500
Usually as developers, we really just care about the script section and dependencies and dev dependencies

00:49.500 --> 00:50.610
and not much else.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.800
Now that we are going to actually be publishing a package, the name and version fields are going to

00:55.800 --> 00:57.840
start to become very, very important.

00:57.870 --> 01:01.890
There are a couple of other fields we're going to focus on over time, but right now let's just focus

01:01.890 --> 01:03.240
on name and version.

01:03.910 --> 01:07.960
So for name, we're going to specify obviously the name of our package.

01:08.140 --> 01:12.760
But because we are publishing our package inside of the organization that we just created, we're going

01:12.760 --> 01:14.890
to use a very special format for our name.

01:15.250 --> 01:19.380
So for the name of our package, we're going to take a look at our organization name.

01:19.390 --> 01:20.860
For me, it's Srg tickets.

01:21.790 --> 01:27.460
And then right here inside the name field, I'm going to change that to at SG tickets slash and then

01:27.460 --> 01:32.440
the name of this very particular package I'm going to call mine Simply Common.

01:34.240 --> 01:39.370
So by putting our name in as this format, this means that we want to publish a package called Common

01:39.370 --> 01:41.830
to the Srg Tickets Organization.

01:44.080 --> 01:44.530
All right.

01:44.530 --> 01:47.290
So now that we've got that name in there, I'm going to save this file.

01:47.320 --> 01:53.080
Now, I want to immediately attempt to publish this package to my organization or the NPM registry.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.090
To publish this thing.

01:55.090 --> 01:56.680
We're going to go back over to our terminal.

01:58.750 --> 02:01.060
We're going to make sure we're still inside of our common directory.

02:01.420 --> 02:05.290
And inside here, we're going to first begin by creating a new git repository.

02:05.440 --> 02:10.240
In order to publish a package, we must have everything inside this directory committed to git.

02:10.240 --> 02:15.520
9 p.m. is going to check our git repo created inside this folder and make sure everything has been committed

02:15.520 --> 02:16.990
before we attempt to publish it.

02:17.620 --> 02:20.110
So I'm going to create a new git repository by running.

02:20.110 --> 02:20.830
Get in it.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.190
I'll then add everything inside of here.

02:25.870 --> 02:29.470
And then I will commit all of it as initial commit.

02:30.790 --> 02:34.900
And then after that, we can then attempt to publish this package to our organization.

02:35.770 --> 02:41.620
To do so we will write out and PM publish and then dash dash access public.

02:41.890 --> 02:46.510
If we do not add on this access public flag right here, then MPM is going to assume that we want to

02:46.510 --> 02:49.640
publish this as a private package inside of our organization.

02:49.660 --> 02:53.800
We'll then throw an error because we have to pay money to publish a private package.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.020
All right, so I'm going to run that command.

02:57.700 --> 03:01.600
And we should, after a little pause here, eventually see the thing published.

03:01.630 --> 03:06.100
Now, very quickly, if you immediately see an error message, if you see something that says you must

03:06.100 --> 03:11.350
log in or something that says you do not have access and make sure that you run the command and PM log

03:11.350 --> 03:15.220
in, you'll be prompted to enter in your username and password right here.

03:16.180 --> 03:20.110
You'll want to enter the same username and password that use back over here on NPM.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.100
So hopefully you will be able to publish this thing.

03:24.400 --> 03:29.200
Once we've published this module, we can now install it into any of our other services.

03:29.500 --> 03:33.730
We can also take a look at our published package on NPM itself.

03:34.330 --> 03:39.850
As a matter of fact, if I go back over to my organization page, I can refresh it, then go to the

03:39.850 --> 03:40.870
packages tab.

03:41.790 --> 03:44.220
And I'll see my published package right there.

03:44.490 --> 03:49.920
So this can now be installed into any other module or any other project I'm working on very easily,

03:49.920 --> 03:51.220
in the same way you are already used to.

03:51.240 --> 03:54.810
We just have to run npm install and then put in our package name.

03:56.040 --> 03:56.360
Okay.

03:56.370 --> 04:01.230
Now that we've got this thing, or at least an initial version of it published, let's take a pause

04:01.230 --> 04:05.940
right here and start to add in some actual implementation for our common module in just a moment.
