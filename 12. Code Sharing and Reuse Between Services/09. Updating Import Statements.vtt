00:00.660 --> 00:05.340
We have now published a working build of our common module, so we're now going to go back over to our

00:05.700 --> 00:07.820
service inside of our OTT service.

00:07.830 --> 00:12.900
If we open up that CRC directory, open up routes and then open up, say the current user file.

00:12.930 --> 00:16.020
We've got a ton of broken import statements inside of here.

00:16.260 --> 00:21.330
So to fix all these up, we're going to install our common module into the project.

00:21.420 --> 00:25.460
After we install that will then go through all the different files inside of our project.

00:25.470 --> 00:30.060
We will find any broken import statements like the one we have right here and fix those all up.

00:30.390 --> 00:31.590
So let's get to it.

00:32.070 --> 00:38.790
Back at my terminal, I'm going to change over to my auth project directory and then I will install

00:38.790 --> 00:41.280
my common module so I'll do an NPM install.

00:41.460 --> 00:45.540
Then my organization name which is Srg tickets slash common.

00:45.930 --> 00:50.710
Remember, you definitely have a different organization name to remember what yours is.

00:50.730 --> 00:55.890
You can always go back over to your common directory, find the package JSON file inside there and then

00:55.890 --> 00:57.750
look up the name field right there.

01:00.380 --> 01:02.330
All right, so I'm going to install a common.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.400
It should be pretty quick.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.770
And there we go.

01:09.160 --> 01:15.790
So now that we have all that code inside of our off project, let's start to update these import statements.

01:16.210 --> 01:20.260
We're going to do this in a very methodical fashion where it's going to go into our CRC directory and

01:20.260 --> 01:24.100
we're going to go through all the files inside of here from top to bottom, one at a time.

01:24.100 --> 01:28.000
And we're going to make sure that we don't have any errors in any import statements anywhere across

01:28.000 --> 01:28.570
the board.

01:29.110 --> 01:31.390
So we will first begin inside of user tests.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.570
Well, I don't see any errors with the import statements inside of here.

01:34.570 --> 01:36.010
So let's close this.

01:36.900 --> 01:37.900
Let's go into the roots.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.460
Underscore.

01:38.460 --> 01:38.910
Underscore.

01:38.910 --> 01:39.870
Test directory.

01:40.780 --> 01:42.100
Current user test file.

01:42.130 --> 01:43.090
No issues here.

01:43.980 --> 01:45.220
Sign and test file.

01:45.270 --> 01:46.230
No issues here.

01:47.010 --> 01:47.670
Sign out.

01:47.910 --> 01:48.750
No problem.

01:48.960 --> 01:49.890
And sign up.

01:50.010 --> 01:50.910
No problem.

01:52.520 --> 01:55.190
All right out of the test directory into a current user.

01:55.610 --> 01:57.920
And right away I see some air start to appear.

01:58.220 --> 02:02.090
So our current user middleware is no longer defined inside this middleware directory.

02:02.270 --> 02:05.000
We don't even have a middleware directory inside the auth module.

02:05.270 --> 02:10.160
So we need to update this import statement to try to get the current user middleware out of our common

02:10.160 --> 02:11.180
module instead.

02:11.450 --> 02:13.880
So all we have to do is update that import statement.

02:15.180 --> 02:20.910
So I'll put inside of here the name of my module SG tickets slash comment and again for you you will

02:20.910 --> 02:22.680
have a different organisation name.

02:23.650 --> 02:25.870
So as soon as I add that in air goes away.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.070
That's pretty much it.

02:27.820 --> 02:30.940
So we're going to repeat that same process for all the remaining files.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.530
Let's go over to sign in.

02:33.510 --> 02:35.340
Looks like we've got two errors right here.

02:35.370 --> 02:36.750
Now, this is actually kind of nice.

02:36.750 --> 02:42.300
We were importing a middleware and air in separate import statements, validate request and bad request

02:42.300 --> 02:42.720
error.

02:43.140 --> 02:47.790
Both these things are now being exported from the same location inside of our shared module, so we

02:47.790 --> 02:50.310
can actually condense these two imports down to one.

02:50.610 --> 02:51.510
Let me show you how.

02:52.380 --> 02:52.770
Up here.

02:52.770 --> 02:56.250
I'll put in an import for validate request.

02:57.190 --> 02:59.710
And bad request air.

03:00.610 --> 03:03.040
From SG tickets.

03:04.820 --> 03:05.510
Common.

03:08.970 --> 03:11.010
I'll then delete the other two imports.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.330
And we're good to go.

03:17.070 --> 03:17.510
Okay.

03:18.090 --> 03:19.140
That's it for CNN.

03:19.170 --> 03:20.850
Let's move on to sign out.

03:21.390 --> 03:23.970
Well, no issue here about sign up.

03:25.010 --> 03:25.220
Okay.

03:25.220 --> 03:27.440
We got two more here, so let's fix those up.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.360
I'll do an import of validate request.

03:33.590 --> 03:36.470
And bad request air.

03:37.290 --> 03:38.010
From.

03:38.700 --> 03:39.390
There we go.

03:39.630 --> 03:41.430
And then delete the old imports.

03:45.380 --> 03:45.480
Get.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.380
That looks good.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.200
That's it for our roots directory.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.940
I'll take a look at these services file.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.340
So inside of services, I got password TS.

03:54.340 --> 03:55.690
Well, no issue here.

03:55.930 --> 03:57.700
How about inside of our test directory?

03:57.970 --> 03:58.360
Nope.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.530
No issue here.

04:00.350 --> 04:01.960
About inside of apts.

04:02.320 --> 04:06.430
Instead of APTs, we've got that air handler and the not found air as well.

04:06.700 --> 04:09.730
So let's make sure we get those out of our custom module.

04:11.350 --> 04:11.740
Up here.

04:11.740 --> 04:16.420
I'll get air handler and not found air.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.870
From SG tickets comin.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.480
And then once again, I'll delete the old ones.

04:26.310 --> 04:27.330
Well, that looks good.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.810
I'll do a quick check inside the file.

04:28.830 --> 04:30.290
No other issues inside of here.

04:30.300 --> 04:34.770
So we are now onto our very last file in texts and inside of here.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.020
Nope.

04:35.070 --> 04:36.120
No issues either.

04:36.570 --> 04:37.620
And that's pretty much it.

04:38.220 --> 04:42.120
So now, in theory, our art module or project should be working A-OK.

04:42.150 --> 04:46.470
So now we should be able to start scaffold back up and just make sure we can still access our project

04:46.470 --> 04:47.400
inside the browser.

04:47.670 --> 04:48.630
So let's get to it.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.190
Back inside of my terminal.

04:51.700 --> 04:55.630
I had previously closed down scaffold when we started moving all that code around.

04:55.780 --> 04:59.410
So inside of my ticketing project directory, I'll do another scaffold dev.

05:01.250 --> 05:06.430
Now as we launch this, we have made a change that packaged JSON file of our off project.

05:06.440 --> 05:10.390
So chances are we're going to have to rebuild that project and install all the dependencies for it.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.800
Once again, that might take a moment or two.

05:12.830 --> 05:16.520
So I'll pause the video right here and we'll do a quick test of our project in the next video.
