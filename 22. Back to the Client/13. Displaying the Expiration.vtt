00:01.310 --> 00:01.670
All right.

00:01.670 --> 00:07.490
Let's make sure that as soon as time left goes to zero or below, we display some simple text that says,

00:07.490 --> 00:09.200
sorry, but this order has expired.

00:09.770 --> 00:13.340
Now, the first thing I want to do here, you'll notice that we had a defaulted use date right here

00:13.340 --> 00:15.860
or a time left piece of state to empty string.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.150
That doesn't really make a lot of sense.

00:17.150 --> 00:17.960
Let's have it.

00:18.290 --> 00:21.710
Get or give that thing a default value of just zero instead.

00:23.490 --> 00:26.670
So now after effect, I'm going to add in a little check.

00:26.670 --> 00:30.000
I'm going to say if time left is less than zero.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.350
Then let's return a div.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.070
That says order expired.

00:38.190 --> 00:38.580
Yet.

00:38.580 --> 00:42.240
Let's save flip back over order expired naturally.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.950
Let's make sure that's not being displayed all the time.

00:43.950 --> 00:45.870
So I'm going to create yet another order.

00:46.810 --> 00:46.950
Okay.

00:47.050 --> 00:47.860
So there's the timer.

00:47.860 --> 00:53.030
And now as soon as it goes into the negatives, it should update and say order expired instead, just

00:53.030 --> 00:53.920
to make sure this thing works.

00:53.920 --> 00:54.970
I'm going to pause the video right here.

00:54.970 --> 00:59.050
I'm going to let my timer count down and then come back in just a moment and we'll just make sure that,

00:59.050 --> 01:01.030
yes, this thing does update appropriately.
