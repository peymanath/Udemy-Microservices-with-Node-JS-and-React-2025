00:01.210 --> 00:05.980
I just watched my timer count down to zero, eventually hit zero and then updated automatically over

00:05.980 --> 00:07.150
to order expired.

00:07.330 --> 00:10.180
So I'd say that the timer is working out pretty well.

00:10.810 --> 00:16.090
Now, the last thing we have to do on this order show page is make sure we have a pay button whenever

00:16.090 --> 00:16.970
a user clicks on pay.

00:16.990 --> 00:21.460
We need to show this little pop up right here where the user will enter in their credit card, expiration

00:21.460 --> 00:22.690
number, all that stuff.

00:23.230 --> 00:26.510
Remember that you and I are not going to be responsible for this form.

00:26.530 --> 00:31.310
Instead, we're going to make use of a library from Stripe that's going to show this form automatically.

00:31.330 --> 00:35.020
It's going to handle the credit card, expiration date, data, all that stuff.

00:35.290 --> 00:38.890
Once a user submits all that, it's going to give back to us a token.

00:39.250 --> 00:43.630
You might remember discussing that token along with Stripe when we were putting together our payment

00:43.630 --> 00:44.260
service.

00:44.590 --> 00:49.660
So after our user submits this thing, we're going to get back a token on the React side of our application,

00:49.840 --> 00:52.810
and we will make a post request off to our payment service.

00:52.810 --> 00:56.800
And the payment service will then be responsible for billing the user's credit card.

00:58.810 --> 01:02.760
Now to actually show this model, we're going to install a library off of AMPM.

01:02.770 --> 01:05.380
So let's go take a look at the documentation for that right away.

01:06.350 --> 01:11.300
At 9 p.m., I'm going to do a search for React strip checkout.

01:13.710 --> 01:14.970
Here's the first result.

01:15.740 --> 01:18.860
And so if you want to, you can definitely take a look at the documentation here.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.500
It is pretty easy and straightforward to use.

01:21.830 --> 01:26.540
All we really have to do is import this library as strip checkout.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.450
We're then going to show it as though it were a react component.

01:30.870 --> 01:35.880
At a very minimum, we have to provide a callback function to the token prop that is going to be invoked

01:35.880 --> 01:41.010
any time a user submits their payment information and this thing gets a token back from the Stripe API.

01:41.610 --> 01:45.780
So we are going to provide this callback right here that's going to receive that token and that's where

01:45.780 --> 01:48.420
you and I are going to make our post request to our payment service.

01:49.170 --> 01:54.930
The other required property is the stripe key, that is the published publishable key which we can get

01:54.930 --> 01:56.640
from our Stripe dashboard.

01:57.090 --> 02:02.670
So if you go back to your Stripe dashboard at Dashboard Stripe, you can find developers on the left

02:03.240 --> 02:07.020
API keys, and that is the publishable key right there that we want.

02:09.830 --> 02:14.000
Those are the two required properties, but there are several other properties that we probably want

02:14.000 --> 02:14.720
as well.

02:16.300 --> 02:19.360
So you can see a big list of all the other properties we can pass in.

02:20.080 --> 02:24.220
The other one that you and I are probably going to want to provide is a mount that's going to make sure

02:24.220 --> 02:28.690
that we get the user's credit card authorization for a very specific amount of money.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.430
We might also want to pass in the email of the user as well.

02:32.640 --> 02:36.720
If we pass in the email, that's just going to make sure that the form kind of pre populates the user's

02:36.720 --> 02:40.560
email as opposed to require them to enter in their email again separately.

02:41.410 --> 02:41.650
All right.

02:41.650 --> 02:43.690
So with this in mind, let's go over to our terminal.

02:43.690 --> 02:48.340
We're going to install react stripe checkout and then make use of it inside of our order show component.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.610
So back at my terminal, I'll change into our client directory.

02:53.310 --> 02:56.820
And then do an NPM install for react stripe checkout.

02:59.850 --> 03:00.150
Okay.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.440
I'm going to let it do its thing.

03:01.470 --> 03:06.090
We'll come back together in the next video and make use of that inside of our order show component.
