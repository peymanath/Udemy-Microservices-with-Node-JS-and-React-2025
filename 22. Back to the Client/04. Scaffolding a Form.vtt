00:00.690 --> 00:04.770
Now that we've fixed up a little issue or two, we're going to start adding in some these new routes.

00:04.830 --> 00:08.520
The first route we're going to work on is going to give the user the ability to create a ticket.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.810
So it will be a very simple form where a user will enter in a title and a price.

00:14.200 --> 00:19.360
We're going to make this as a new route accessible at tickets new and to implement that route.

00:19.390 --> 00:23.020
Naturally, we have to create a file at ticket slash new JS.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.210
So let's create that new file right now.

00:26.050 --> 00:27.370
Back inside my editor.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.560
I'm going to find my pages directory.

00:29.590 --> 00:31.990
Inside there, I'll make a new folder called Tickets.

00:32.200 --> 00:36.160
And then inside there, I'll make a new file of new JS.

00:37.010 --> 00:41.990
Inside of this new JSS file, I'm going to create a new component called New Ticket.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.720
At the bottom, I will immediately export it.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.560
And inside the component itself right now.

00:51.560 --> 00:52.880
Let's just throw in a div.

00:55.240 --> 00:59.770
And I'll give it maybe an H one that says Create a ticket.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.800
Let's immediately save this.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.130
Go back over to our browser and just make sure that we can access this new route.

01:06.560 --> 01:12.580
Those should be able to access ticketing, dot dev tickets, slash new and see create a ticket, appear

01:12.580 --> 01:15.850
on the screen like so it's only reasonable.

01:16.890 --> 01:17.100
Now.

01:17.100 --> 01:20.070
Next up, well, let's start to add in the form itself.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.640
For the form, I'll go back over to my new ticket component.

01:25.340 --> 01:27.980
We're going to add in a decent amount of sex here.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.720
So we'll put in a form element.

01:31.940 --> 01:36.880
I'm going to give it a div that has a class name of form group.

01:38.590 --> 01:39.490
Inside that div.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.080
I'll place a label.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.000
That has tech's title.

01:46.180 --> 01:48.640
After that, I'll put in a simple input.

01:49.850 --> 01:52.040
I then going to duplicate that entire div.

01:53.180 --> 01:56.000
And I'll change the label over to price instead.

01:57.980 --> 02:02.990
And then finally after the second div that we just copy paste it in, I'll place a button with the class

02:02.990 --> 02:04.850
name of BTN.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.860
BTN primary.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.910
And I'll give it some text of submit.

02:13.700 --> 02:14.730
Pretty simple start.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.490
Let's take a look at what that looks like.

02:16.850 --> 02:17.120
Yep.

02:17.120 --> 02:17.810
There we go.

02:20.880 --> 02:21.000
Okay.

02:21.120 --> 02:26.100
Now that we've got that put together, we need to make sure that we also add in to these inputs.

02:26.100 --> 02:30.390
Just a quick class name just to fix up some of the styling on both the inputs.

02:30.750 --> 02:34.050
I'm going to add a class name of form control.

02:36.950 --> 02:39.110
And form control.

02:40.210 --> 02:42.280
If I now save that and flip back over, we'll now see.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.690
It stretches the entire length.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.840
Now, having it stretched the entire length looks just a little bit weird.

02:46.840 --> 02:50.050
We don't really have any gap on the left hand side or the right hand side.

02:50.470 --> 02:53.440
So to fix that up, we're going to go back over to our app component.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.790
We're just going to add in really quickly an additional little class that's going to give us a little

02:57.790 --> 02:59.590
bit of spacing on either side.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.520
So on the app component.

03:04.220 --> 03:07.130
I'm going to find where we create the actual component right here.

03:07.130 --> 03:09.590
So that's the child component that we're trying to show to the user.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.450
And I'm going to wrap it with a div.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.410
That has a class name of container.

03:18.100 --> 03:22.040
Now, if I save that, I'll see that I get that nice border on both sides of the screen.

03:22.580 --> 03:25.430
And you probably see something a little bit closer to that.

03:25.430 --> 03:29.630
Just again, as a reminder, as usual, I run my screen really far, zoomed in, just you can see everything

03:29.630 --> 03:30.710
I'm doing very easily.

03:31.990 --> 03:32.200
Okay.

03:32.230 --> 03:33.190
So that's a good start.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.460
Let's take a pause right here.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.440
When we come back, the next video.

03:35.470 --> 03:40.580
We'll make sure that we add in some state to track the values the user is entering and then make a request

03:40.580 --> 03:43.180
to eventually create a new ticket on our back end server.
