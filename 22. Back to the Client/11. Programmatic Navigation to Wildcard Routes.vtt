00:01.010 --> 00:02.630
A user can now create an order.

00:02.630 --> 00:06.980
So when they do so by clicking on that purchase button, we need to make sure that we then navigate

00:06.980 --> 00:08.990
the user over to a new page.

00:09.290 --> 00:12.770
So this is going to be orders slash the ID of the order.

00:13.700 --> 00:16.430
Pretty much this last row down here.

00:17.150 --> 00:22.010
So we're going to have to create a new route inside of a new order's directory inside of our pages folder.

00:22.040 --> 00:25.430
We'll call this component order show or something similar to that.

00:26.030 --> 00:31.400
So inside of here, we're going to want to fetch details about the order using that order ID right there,

00:31.400 --> 00:35.750
and then just print out some information about it on the screen and eventually put on this payment button

00:35.750 --> 00:36.440
as well.

00:37.010 --> 00:40.910
The other little challenge we're going to have to take care of is this little timer where we're going

00:40.940 --> 00:44.360
to tell the user how many seconds they have left to actually pay for the order.

00:45.250 --> 00:45.430
Okay.

00:45.430 --> 00:46.300
Let's get to it.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.040
Inside of my editor.

00:48.700 --> 00:52.150
I'm going to find my pages directory inside the client folder.

00:53.960 --> 00:54.560
Inside there.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.770
I'll make a new directory of orders.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.650
And then I want to add in a new wild card route.

01:01.660 --> 01:04.450
So I'm going to add it in there inside a square brackets.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.120
Order ID dot jazz.

01:08.420 --> 01:12.560
Once again, let's just put in some very simple markup right now and then focus on how we can navigate

01:12.560 --> 01:15.740
a user over immediately after the order is created.

01:17.090 --> 01:19.700
They'll put in a new component called Order Show.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.660
Actually I think we've been using a slightly different convention having oh no, we have similar conventions.

01:25.660 --> 01:26.280
So ticket show.

01:26.290 --> 01:27.580
Yeah, a good enough order show.

01:27.580 --> 01:28.480
It matches up.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.580
All right, so let's return to Div.

01:32.110 --> 01:34.510
And say, Order, Joe.

01:36.110 --> 01:38.860
An export default order show at the bottom.

01:40.500 --> 01:40.800
All right.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.270
So now back inside the component.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.940
We are just working at that ticket ID wild card.

01:45.330 --> 01:50.580
We want to navigate a user over to the order show component whenever on success gets invoked, because

01:50.580 --> 01:53.250
that's the point at which we know that, hey, order has been created.

01:53.250 --> 01:56.730
We should now navigate the user over and show them details about this order.

01:58.140 --> 02:02.250
As a reminder that function is going to be called with the order that was just created.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.490
So inside there we already have access to the ID of the order.

02:05.700 --> 02:09.900
So all we really have to do is figure out how to programmatically navigate a user right here instead

02:09.900 --> 02:11.340
of doing the simple console log.

02:12.300 --> 02:12.400
Now.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.820
We've already seen programmatic navigation once before.

02:14.850 --> 02:18.000
We're going to import router from next router at the top.

02:23.050 --> 02:25.930
And then we can call router dot push.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.600
Just one little issue here.

02:28.630 --> 02:32.560
Once again, we are navigating programmatically over to a wild card route.

02:32.830 --> 02:37.060
Remember what I mentioned just a little bit ago when we were working on that link element inside of

02:37.060 --> 02:38.140
our landing page?

02:38.410 --> 02:40.820
So back inside the landing page, here it is right here.

02:40.840 --> 02:46.120
I told you that to create a link element, to go to a wild card route, we had to provide both the ref

02:46.120 --> 02:47.110
and as.

02:47.110 --> 02:51.880
And I'd also said we have to do something similar when making use of route or push to go to a wild card

02:51.880 --> 02:52.810
route as well.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.180
So yep, that's what we can do right now.

02:55.750 --> 03:02.290
So to make use of route dot push to navigate to a wild card route, we're going to first put in an argument

03:02.620 --> 03:07.930
that is essentially the path to the file or essentially the file name path, whatever you want to call

03:07.930 --> 03:09.400
it, inside of our pages directory.

03:09.730 --> 03:15.640
So for us, it'll be slash orders, slash square brackets, order ID.

03:15.850 --> 03:18.070
And again, no extension is required.

03:19.640 --> 03:23.660
Then as a second argument, we're going to put in the actual URL that we're trying to go to.

03:23.690 --> 03:26.420
So order slash the real ID of the order.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.570
And once again, we're going to use some string templating for this.

03:29.570 --> 03:32.510
So I'll put in some back tactics, orders.

03:33.250 --> 03:37.810
And then I'm going to reference the ID property of the order that is being provided to on success.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.520
So order ID.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.560
And that should be it.

03:43.170 --> 03:44.190
I'm going to save this.

03:46.070 --> 03:48.710
And go back and do another quick test.

03:50.510 --> 03:51.370
The back over here.

03:51.380 --> 03:55.910
The first order that I had created around my first client ticket should have now expired.

03:55.940 --> 03:58.100
It has definitely been at least 60 seconds.

03:58.430 --> 04:03.560
So now attempt to purchase this ticket and as soon as I do, I will get navigated automatically over

04:03.560 --> 04:04.460
to order show.

04:05.000 --> 04:05.540
Cool.

04:06.640 --> 04:06.830
Okay.

04:06.890 --> 04:07.870
Well, that's not too bad.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.770
Let's take another quick pause right here.

04:09.790 --> 04:13.510
When we come back, we're going to tackle this little timer, make sure that the user understands how

04:13.510 --> 04:15.850
much time they have left to actually pay for the order.
