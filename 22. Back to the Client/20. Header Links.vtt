00:01.130 --> 00:03.170
Let's get these two links on our header.

00:03.170 --> 00:06.020
So I want to have a direct link to the page where we create a ticket.

00:06.140 --> 00:10.460
I also want to have a direct link to a new page that we're going to create in just a moment that's going

00:10.460 --> 00:12.890
to list out all the different orders that the user has created.

00:13.490 --> 00:15.390
So first off, how do we add stuff to the header?

00:15.410 --> 00:18.830
Well, remember inside of our client.

00:20.060 --> 00:21.380
Opponent's folder.

00:21.380 --> 00:22.970
We've got the header JS file.

00:23.850 --> 00:28.560
And we put together this clever little system right here of some different links to decide whether we

00:28.560 --> 00:32.190
want to show one set of links based upon whether the user is logged in or not.

00:32.670 --> 00:36.990
So I'm going to add in right above the sign out configuration thing right there.

00:37.350 --> 00:41.100
Another two possible links I can say if there is a current user.

00:41.100 --> 00:45.120
So in other words, if the user is logged in, then I want to have an additional link.

00:45.800 --> 00:49.220
With a label of sell tickets.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.080
And if a user clicks on that, I want to direct them to.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.740
Tickets slash new.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.340
And then right after that, I'm going to add in one other link.

01:03.340 --> 01:05.170
I'll say if the user is logged in.

01:06.210 --> 01:10.170
Give me another link that has a label of something like my orders.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.370
And we do not have this route put together just yet.

01:13.370 --> 01:18.020
But I'm sure you can imagine that we probably want to give this thing a route of something like just

01:18.020 --> 01:19.100
slash orders.

01:19.310 --> 01:24.050
So if we go to slash orders, I want to show a listing of all the orders the user has created.

01:25.780 --> 01:25.970
Okay.

01:26.020 --> 01:26.890
Let's save that.

01:28.690 --> 01:29.860
Go do a quick test.

01:30.100 --> 01:34.270
Looks like we've now got those links inside the header, so I should be able to click on it, sell tickets,

01:34.270 --> 01:36.340
and go directly to the create a ticket form.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.910
And if I click on my orders right now.

01:38.910 --> 01:39.210
Yep.

01:39.210 --> 01:43.470
Again, we have not implemented this just yet, so let's pause right here and then put together this

01:43.470 --> 01:46.740
listing of all orders that belong to this user in just a moment.
