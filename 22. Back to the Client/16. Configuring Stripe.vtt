00:01.370 --> 00:06.350
I've now installed the React Stripe checkout module, so inside of order show at the very top I'm going

00:06.350 --> 00:11.630
to import Stripe checkout from React Stripe checkout.

00:13.480 --> 00:17.920
Ben for right now, I'm always going to show an instance of this thing down at the very bottom where

00:17.920 --> 00:19.480
we have our timer for right now.

00:20.560 --> 00:21.700
So inside that div.

00:23.060 --> 00:24.500
Right after all that text.

00:25.260 --> 00:28.830
I'm going to put in React or simply just stripe checkout.

00:29.130 --> 00:29.760
Here we go.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.270
And then I'm going to make sure that I pass this thing, the two required properties.

00:34.830 --> 00:39.820
So the two required properties are token, which must be a callback function.

00:40.090 --> 00:45.070
So for right now, I'm going to receive the token that we get back from this little component and I'll

00:45.070 --> 00:46.420
just console.log the token.

00:48.330 --> 00:51.360
The second thing we have to provide is our stripe publishable key.

00:51.390 --> 00:52.950
So I'm going to put in Stripe Key.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.300
And then going to go back over to my stripe dashboard.

00:59.590 --> 01:00.970
Here's the publisher key.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.780
I'm going to copy that and throw it in directly right there.

01:05.380 --> 01:10.240
Now, as the name implies, publishable key means that we can safely share this with the outside world.

01:10.240 --> 01:14.230
So there's no security risk if someone gets their hands on this publishable key.

01:14.530 --> 01:19.090
Having said that, it's not always a really great practice to have a hardcoded key directly inside of

01:19.090 --> 01:19.800
your code.

01:19.810 --> 01:25.210
So it would be a little bit better if we instead extracted this thing into a separate helper file or

01:25.210 --> 01:29.620
something like that, even as an environment variable or even a Kubernetes secret.

01:29.830 --> 01:32.890
At this point, I'm going to leave that up to you, because we've gone through the process of creating

01:32.890 --> 01:35.920
secrets, environment variables, all that stuff quite a bit throughout this course.

01:36.190 --> 01:40.330
Do keep in mind, though, that this will be an environment variable that's going to be used with next.

01:40.360 --> 01:44.980
You might want to take a look at the stripe or the next JS documentation and just take a look at how

01:44.980 --> 01:46.480
they handle environment variables.

01:46.690 --> 01:50.170
For me, I feel totally fine just throwing the key directly in here for right now.

01:51.860 --> 01:54.920
After that, we're then going to specify the amount that we want to pay.

01:55.220 --> 01:59.840
So the amount is going to be on the order that we received as a prop.

02:01.160 --> 02:05.420
And if we forget what we actually want to reference on there, we can always go take a look at that

02:05.420 --> 02:06.860
order inside of our request log.

02:09.310 --> 02:11.710
So here it just refreshed.

02:11.710 --> 02:13.240
I lost my request log.

02:13.750 --> 02:14.980
Let me create another order.

02:16.230 --> 02:18.060
There's the request for the order right there.

02:18.670 --> 02:23.620
So on the order that we get back or the order that we have as a prop, we have the ticket property and

02:23.620 --> 02:25.240
inside there is the price.

02:25.810 --> 02:26.950
So we want to take.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.600
Order ticket price and then remember everything around Stripe treats amounts or prices costs however

02:34.600 --> 02:38.050
you want to refer to it as sense as opposed to US dollars.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.800
So we're going to take our price and multiply it by 100.

02:45.150 --> 02:48.330
Finally, I'm going to add on a final prop to this thing of email.

02:49.330 --> 02:51.850
So how are we going to get the user's email inside of here?

02:52.060 --> 02:54.450
Well, let's remove that email for just a second.

02:54.460 --> 02:55.680
We will add it back in.

02:55.690 --> 02:59.170
But first, I want to understand how we can get the user's email inside this component.

02:59.440 --> 03:05.350
You might recall that a little bit ago inside of our app component, which is rendering our child components

03:05.350 --> 03:07.270
in this case, that includes order show.

03:08.670 --> 03:13.320
Inside of our app component, we get access to the current user and we pass that into our child component

03:13.320 --> 03:15.330
as a prop called current user.

03:15.690 --> 03:21.810
So technically, our order show component, the one that we are working on right now, receives a prop

03:21.810 --> 03:23.610
of current user.

03:24.380 --> 03:26.780
So we're going to want to take that current user prop.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.200
And you might recall that inside there is the user's email address.

03:30.470 --> 03:32.060
So we should be able to add in.

03:34.560 --> 03:37.350
Email as current user.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.850
Email like so.

03:40.450 --> 03:40.740
Okay.

03:40.750 --> 03:43.060
So that is all we should need to get started with Stripe.

03:43.060 --> 03:44.110
So let's save this.

03:45.290 --> 03:46.490
I'm going to flip back over.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.900
As usual, my order has already expired.

03:48.920 --> 03:49.800
So let me go back.

03:49.820 --> 03:51.200
Create a new order.

03:52.950 --> 03:58.140
And now we get this pay with card button so I can click on that and that will show my little pop up

03:58.140 --> 03:58.710
window.

03:58.890 --> 04:02.760
Notice how the email is already displayed right there at the top so the user does not have to enter

04:02.760 --> 04:03.630
that separately.

04:04.080 --> 04:07.680
Now all we have to do is put in $20 and we are good to go.

04:08.250 --> 04:08.910
Well, don't worry.

04:08.910 --> 04:11.260
You do not have to put in a real credit card number here.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.760
It turns out that very similar to those test tokens that always work, always succeed.

04:15.780 --> 04:18.540
There's something very similar for credit card numbers as well.

04:18.840 --> 04:22.230
So let's take a pause right here and then test out this little window in just a moment.
