00:00.650 --> 00:05.210
We were able to get that payment modal to appear, but now we need an actual credit card to enter in

00:05.210 --> 00:07.280
there to actually test out this entire flow.

00:07.310 --> 00:13.400
Well, luckily, Stripe has our back in the Stripe documentation, which you can find at Stripe slash

00:13.730 --> 00:14.420
testing.

00:14.780 --> 00:18.470
We can scroll down on this page a little bit and they're going to list out some credit card numbers

00:18.470 --> 00:23.960
right here that are always going to work for any given charge on a Stripe account while the Stripe account

00:23.960 --> 00:25.520
is in the test mode.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.560
And ours is definitely in the test mode right now.

00:28.010 --> 00:34.700
So in other words, if we enter in a credit card number of four to 4 to 4 to any three digit CVC and

00:34.700 --> 00:37.640
any future date, the charge will work as expected.

00:37.850 --> 00:39.350
So let's try that out right now.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.960
I'm going to once again recreate my order because it already has expired.

00:45.060 --> 00:47.280
Well purchase and then pay with card.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.960
By the way, when we click on pay with card, you might see a ton of airs pop up right here and even

00:51.960 --> 00:53.280
a couple of warnings.

00:53.490 --> 00:57.090
All these errors, all the warnings really, truly can be ignored.

00:57.120 --> 01:01.080
We are not using Stripe in such a critical way that these errors or warnings are going to cause any

01:01.080 --> 01:02.160
issue whatsoever.

01:03.390 --> 01:08.460
So now inside this model, I'm going to put in four, two, four, two, four, two, four, two a future

01:08.460 --> 01:11.640
date and then any three digit CVC.

01:12.240 --> 01:16.950
I'll then click on pay $20 and we'll see a console.log right there.

01:17.190 --> 01:18.900
This is our token object.

01:18.900 --> 01:22.110
This is the thing that's going to allow us to charge a user's credit card.

01:22.470 --> 01:25.500
The most important piece of information of this is the ID.

01:25.890 --> 01:27.950
That ID right there is the real token.

01:27.960 --> 01:31.680
We want to take that value and send it off to our payment API.

01:31.950 --> 01:36.630
Our payment API can then do a follow up and charge the user's credit card for this amount of money.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.000
That's pretty much it.

01:38.020 --> 01:42.040
All we can do now is take that ID, make a post request and we are pretty much good to go.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.520
All right, so let's take that ID in the next video.

01:45.550 --> 01:46.450
Make sure we do that post.

01:46.450 --> 01:48.280
You cost off to the payments API.

01:48.310 --> 01:52.660
We also need to make sure that we handle the case in which a user pays for this thing before the order

01:52.660 --> 01:53.440
expires.

01:53.650 --> 01:56.140
So we're pretty close here to getting this entire flow wrapped up.

01:56.140 --> 01:57.640
Just a couple more steps.
