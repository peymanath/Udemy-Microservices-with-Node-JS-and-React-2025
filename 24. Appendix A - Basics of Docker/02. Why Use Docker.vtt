00:00.470 --> 00:01.730
Hello and welcome.

00:01.730 --> 00:06.320
In this section, I want to start to tackle two very important questions that we're going to be answering

00:06.320 --> 00:07.760
throughout this entire course.

00:07.760 --> 00:10.220
The two important questions are what is soccer?

00:10.220 --> 00:12.650
And secondly, why do we use soccer?

00:12.680 --> 00:17.450
We're going to first tackle why we use soccer by going through a quick little demo right now.

00:17.870 --> 00:20.180
Now I'm going to show you a little flow diagram.

00:20.180 --> 00:24.770
And this is a flow of probably a process you've gone through at least once in your life before.

00:24.770 --> 00:27.980
It's a flow of installing software on your personal computer.

00:27.980 --> 00:31.160
And I bet at least once for you this is what has happened.

00:31.160 --> 00:36.410
Maybe you have downloaded some installer, you run that installer, and then inevitably at some point

00:36.410 --> 00:39.860
in time you end up getting an error message during installation.

00:39.860 --> 00:40.910
So what do you do?

00:40.910 --> 00:44.180
Well, you probably troubleshoot the issue by looking on Google.

00:44.180 --> 00:45.530
You try to find a solution.

00:45.530 --> 00:47.510
You eventually solve that issue.

00:47.840 --> 00:53.780
You then rerun the installer only to find, Hey, today you have some other error appearing and then

00:53.780 --> 00:56.750
you have to go through this entire troubleshooting process again.

00:56.870 --> 01:00.200
So this is at its core what Docker is trying to fix.

01:00.200 --> 01:06.020
Docker wants to make it really easy and really straightforward for you to install and run software on

01:06.020 --> 01:11.180
any given computer, not just your computer, not just your personal laptop or your personal desktop,

01:11.180 --> 01:15.590
but on web servers as well or any cloud based computing platform.

01:16.130 --> 01:20.960
I want to give you a very quick demonstration of this flow right here in action and then show you how

01:20.960 --> 01:26.600
quickly I can solve installing a problem or installing a piece of software by making use of Docker.

01:26.690 --> 01:31.520
So I'm going to very quickly go through the flow of installing a piece of software called Redis.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.830
Redis is an in-memory data store.

01:33.830 --> 01:36.080
We're going to be using it quite a bit throughout this course.

01:36.080 --> 01:40.430
But right now, I just want to give you a quick demo of how it can be a little bit challenging to get

01:40.430 --> 01:42.260
installed on your own computer.

01:42.260 --> 01:45.380
So I'm just going to go through the installation steps here very quickly.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.630
So this is the red zone page.

01:47.630 --> 01:49.460
This is the official download page.

01:49.460 --> 01:54.140
In theory, I could use the documentation here to install Redis on my local machine.

01:54.590 --> 01:59.780
I'm going to go down to the installation section and it very proudly says, Oh yeah, just run these

01:59.780 --> 02:02.600
four commands right here and boom, that's pretty much it.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.730
You can then then run Redis.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.950
So I'm going to grab the first command right here.

02:07.130 --> 02:11.000
I'm going to copy it and then I'm going to run it inside of my terminal.

02:13.080 --> 02:13.370
So.

02:13.380 --> 02:15.240
Paste There is the same exact command.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.630
I'm going to run it and sure enough, yep, I get an error message.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.240
Now in this case, the error message is a little bit predictable.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.930
It's complaining about a program that is just not installed on my local machine.

02:24.930 --> 02:29.340
Now, I could definitely go and troubleshoot this, install that program, and then try installing Redis

02:29.370 --> 02:29.850
again.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.140
But that's the whole point.

02:31.140 --> 02:35.910
You kind of get into this endless cycle of trying to do all this troubleshooting as you are installing

02:35.910 --> 02:37.260
and running software.

02:37.260 --> 02:40.110
So let me now show you how easy it is to run Redis.

02:40.140 --> 02:45.330
If you are making use of Docker instead, I'm going to go back over to my command line and I'm going

02:45.330 --> 02:47.610
to run one single command.

02:47.760 --> 02:53.490
I'll say Docker, run, dash it, read like, so I'll hit enter.

02:53.640 --> 03:00.180
And then after a very brief pause, almost instantaneously, I have an instance of Redis up and running

03:00.180 --> 03:02.340
on my computer, and that's pretty much it.

03:02.340 --> 03:04.110
That is Docker in a nutshell.

03:04.110 --> 03:08.070
That is how easy it is to run software when you're making use of Docker.

03:08.370 --> 03:14.850
So to answer the question very directly of why we use Docker, well, we make use of it because it makes

03:14.850 --> 03:20.310
life really easy for installing and running software without having to go through a whole bunch of setup

03:20.310 --> 03:22.530
or installation of dependencies.

03:22.860 --> 03:26.850
Now we're going to learn many more reasons throughout this course of why we use Docker.

03:26.850 --> 03:31.170
But I want to give you a very quick demo and show you how easy it can be to get up and running with

03:31.170 --> 03:33.840
some new piece of software when you are using Docker.

03:34.260 --> 03:35.670
Let's take a quick pause right here.

03:35.670 --> 03:39.720
We're going to come back to the next section and start trying to the answer of answer the question of

03:39.720 --> 03:41.040
what Docker is.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.600
So I'll see you in just a minute.
