00:00.510 --> 00:03.780
In the last section we spoke about how we make our own custom image.

00:03.780 --> 00:08.370
We create a Docker file, we feed it into the Docker server, and that's going to eventually build a

00:08.370 --> 00:11.940
useful image that we can use to start up our own custom containers.

00:11.940 --> 00:17.040
And inside that Docker file, we're going to specify a base image, run some commands, and then eventually

00:17.040 --> 00:20.820
specify a command to run when a container is created out of the image.

00:20.820 --> 00:24.870
So in this section we're going to start working on our own custom Docker file.

00:24.990 --> 00:28.230
Let me first tell you about what we're going to be trying to build.

00:28.380 --> 00:34.620
So we are going to make a Docker file that is going to create an image that's going to run Redis server

00:34.620 --> 00:35.880
whenever it starts up.

00:36.060 --> 00:40.530
Now, throughout this course, we've already been making use of that Redis image to start up right on

00:40.530 --> 00:41.790
our local computer.

00:41.790 --> 00:47.940
But I want to show you how to build that thing from scratch or somewhat from scratch, just to be precise.

00:47.940 --> 00:52.980
So this is going to be going to be the purpose of our Docker file and the image that we're going to

00:52.980 --> 00:53.940
create out of it.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.010
So let's get started right now.

00:56.370 --> 01:02.430
I'm going to first begin by flipping over to my terminal and I'm going to create a new working directory

01:02.430 --> 01:04.770
or kind of a project directory of sorts.

01:05.580 --> 01:09.270
And I'm going to call it Redis image like.

01:09.270 --> 01:13.560
So now you can put this folder anywhere you want on your machine.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.340
Doesn't matter.

01:14.340 --> 01:15.540
Anywhere is good.

01:16.050 --> 01:21.930
I'll then change into that directory and then I'm going to start up my code editor inside that folder.

01:22.320 --> 01:23.310
Now a quick note.

01:23.310 --> 01:27.690
I am making use of Visual Studio code and I have configured it so that I could run it from the command

01:27.690 --> 01:28.020
line.

01:28.020 --> 01:31.080
So that is why I am able to run a code right here.

01:31.140 --> 01:35.730
If you have not gone through those same steps, you will not be able to run that command and start up

01:35.730 --> 01:36.600
your editor.

01:36.780 --> 01:41.610
Essentially, all you need to do right now is start up whatever code editor you like to use and open

01:41.610 --> 01:44.670
up that Redis image directory that we just created.

01:46.050 --> 01:52.500
Then inside of here, I'm going to make a new file called Docker File and notice how it has a capital

01:52.500 --> 01:54.690
D and it has no extension.

01:54.810 --> 01:58.770
So there's no JSON here, there's no shell, there's nothing like that.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.990
It is simply called Docker file.

02:01.710 --> 02:06.450
So then inside of here, we're going to write out a couple of comments to guide us through the process

02:06.450 --> 02:08.700
of creating our custom image.

02:08.700 --> 02:12.000
And it's going to essentially follow this template of steps right here.

02:12.360 --> 02:16.410
So the first comment I'm going to put down and notice how we create a comment by putting down the pound

02:16.410 --> 02:22.170
symbol, I'm going to say that I'm going to use an existing Docker image as a base.

02:23.690 --> 02:30.740
I'm then going to download and install a dependency and then finally I'm going to tell the image what

02:30.740 --> 02:34.880
to do when it starts as a container.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.040
All right.

02:38.610 --> 02:42.000
Now, I'll be honest with you, the way we're going to approach this Docker file, we're just going

02:42.000 --> 02:45.030
to write out all the code inside of here, all the configuration.

02:45.030 --> 02:46.770
We're going to use it to build our image.

02:46.770 --> 02:50.910
And then we're going to come back and talk about all the configuration that we've written inside of

02:50.910 --> 02:51.330
here.

02:51.450 --> 02:55.980
To be honest, it's a lot easier to understand the configuration that we're going to write after you've

02:55.980 --> 02:58.860
actually seen the process of creating an image.

02:58.860 --> 03:02.040
So a little bit of just blind copy pasting here.

03:02.250 --> 03:07.200
So just follow along and we'll very quickly come back and talk about the exact lines of code that we're

03:07.200 --> 03:07.890
adding in.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.950
So the first thing I'm going to write down is from.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.550
Alpine.

03:14.020 --> 03:20.020
Then in the next section I'm going to add run APK add dash dash.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.910
Update Redis.

03:23.090 --> 03:30.980
And then finally on the very bottom line here, I'm going to add CMD, a set of square brackets, a

03:30.980 --> 03:36.500
set of double quotes, and then inside there I'll put redis dash server like so.

03:37.660 --> 03:37.990
Now.

03:37.990 --> 03:39.310
I'm going to save this file.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.400
I'm going to flip back over to my terminal.

03:42.670 --> 03:46.420
I'm going to make sure that I'm inside of that red dash image directory.

03:46.420 --> 03:48.280
And I'm going to run the line.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.330
Run the command.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.630
Excuse me, Docker, build dot.

03:53.170 --> 03:54.910
Don't forget the little dot on there.

03:54.940 --> 03:56.380
Notice how there's a little period.

03:56.560 --> 04:01.660
So I'm going to run that and then we're going to very quickly see a whole bunch of outputs start to

04:01.660 --> 04:02.560
stream along here.

04:02.560 --> 04:07.240
And then eventually I see a message that says Successfully built and then blah, blah, blah.

04:08.110 --> 04:14.860
Now we're going to copy this ID right here and then run, Docker run, and then I'll paste that ID in

04:15.700 --> 04:17.200
and execute this.

04:18.690 --> 04:23.160
And then we're going to very quickly see all the kind of output here that we saw previously when we

04:23.160 --> 04:25.320
ran that Docker, seeing the reddest image.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.920
And the last message I should see is ready to accept connections.

04:29.880 --> 04:33.840
So we just went through the process of creating the Docker file, using it to build an image, and then

04:33.840 --> 04:35.100
we started that image up.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.520
But we haven't really said anything about what really happened there.

04:38.550 --> 04:40.850
I'm going to stop the running container by pressing control.

04:40.860 --> 04:45.480
See, we're going to take a quick break, come back the next section and talk about exactly what we

04:45.480 --> 04:48.290
just did inside this file and at the terminal.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.490
So a quick break and I'll see you in just a minute.
