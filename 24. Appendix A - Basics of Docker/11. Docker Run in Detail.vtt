00:00.720 --> 00:05.070
Starting this section and the next couple, we're going to start to look at the Docker client or Docker

00:05.070 --> 00:09.330
CLI inside of our terminal a little bit more and learn about some of the very basic commands that we

00:09.330 --> 00:12.240
use to interact with Docker containers and images.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.950
Now, fair warning here.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.130
Some of these sections are going to be a little bit boring because we're essentially just going to be

00:17.130 --> 00:19.920
typing in commands and looking at the output that comes.

00:19.920 --> 00:24.210
But I'm going to do my best to make sure to share a lot of interesting information with you along the

00:24.210 --> 00:24.630
way.

00:24.630 --> 00:25.820
So let's get to it.

00:25.830 --> 00:29.190
The first command that we're going to look at is one that we ran very briefly before.

00:29.220 --> 00:35.790
It is a command that we're going to use to run or to create and run a container using an image.

00:36.210 --> 00:41.700
So at the command line, we're going to execute Docker run, and then the name of the image that we

00:41.700 --> 00:44.100
want to use as the basis for this container.

00:44.250 --> 00:49.560
Now we've already gone through this process once before at the command line we ran Docker Run Hello

00:50.040 --> 00:53.490
World and then we saw that message appear on the screen.

00:53.880 --> 00:59.370
Now using the knowledge that you now have about what a Docker container really is, I want you to think

00:59.370 --> 01:02.460
about what probably just occurred when we ran that command.

01:02.880 --> 01:10.230
Chances are that somewhere on our hard disk is an image that has that file system snapshot with one

01:10.230 --> 01:11.940
single program inside of it.

01:11.980 --> 01:15.540
Maybe that thing is called, I don't know, Hello World, who knows what it's really called.

01:16.380 --> 01:22.500
So when we executed Docker Run Hello World, we took that little snapshot of the hard drive.

01:23.040 --> 01:29.010
We stuck it into this little container thing or this kind of grouping of resources, and then we executed

01:29.010 --> 01:30.300
the command run.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.200
Hello World.

01:31.200 --> 01:36.810
And so the running process up here was Hello World, that thing ran and then eventually exited.

01:37.140 --> 01:40.680
So that's what is happening behind the scenes when you execute that command.

01:40.800 --> 01:46.200
Now there's a lot of variations on this, a Docker run command and a lot of very small subtleties around

01:46.200 --> 01:46.350
it.

01:46.350 --> 01:47.580
So let's take a quick pause.

01:47.580 --> 01:48.960
We're going to come back the next section.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.260
We're going to start looking at some of the interesting features around the run command.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.730
So I'll see you in just a minute.
