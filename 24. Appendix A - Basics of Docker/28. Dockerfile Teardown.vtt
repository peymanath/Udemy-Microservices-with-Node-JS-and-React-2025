00:00.780 --> 00:05.640
In the last section, we put together our very first Docker file and then very quickly used it at the

00:05.640 --> 00:07.570
terminal to build a new image.

00:07.590 --> 00:10.680
However, we didn't really talk about what was going on inside of here.

00:10.680 --> 00:15.630
So in this section and the next, I want to do a deep dive on all the configuration that we added to

00:15.630 --> 00:19.940
the Docker file and also what happened over at the terminal afterwards.

00:19.950 --> 00:21.180
So let's get to it.

00:22.230 --> 00:22.890
All right.

00:22.890 --> 00:27.450
So I took every line out of that Docker file except for the comments and put it into this diagram right

00:27.450 --> 00:28.000
here.

00:28.020 --> 00:33.840
So you see from Alpine Run and Command, you'll notice that every line of configuration that we put

00:33.840 --> 00:36.570
in there looked kind of similar to the others.

00:36.660 --> 00:41.350
Every line started off with a single word that we refer to as an instruction.

00:41.370 --> 00:47.940
This instruction is telling the Docker server to do some very specific preparation, step on the image

00:47.940 --> 00:49.320
that we are trying to create.

00:49.980 --> 00:56.220
The instruction from is used to specify the Docker image that we want to use as a base.

00:56.700 --> 01:03.480
The run instruction is used to execute some command while we are preparing our custom image and then

01:03.480 --> 01:10.710
the CMD or command instruction specifies what should be executed when our container is when our image

01:10.710 --> 01:13.230
is used to start up a brand new container.

01:13.650 --> 01:18.090
Every line of configuration that you are ever going to add to a Docker file is always going to start

01:18.090 --> 01:19.740
off with an instruction.

01:20.690 --> 01:23.780
Now we just used the three most important instructions to know.

01:23.780 --> 01:28.270
There are quite another quite a handful of other instructions out there.

01:28.280 --> 01:31.280
We're going to look at a handful of them throughout the rest of this course.

01:31.280 --> 01:36.260
But again, from run and CMD are the most important ones to know and understand.

01:36.770 --> 01:41.840
After each instruction, we then provided an argument to the instruction that kind of customised how

01:41.840 --> 01:43.400
that instruction was executed.

01:43.400 --> 01:50.390
So as you might guess, by putting from Alpine, we are saying we want to use a base image of Alpine

01:50.390 --> 01:55.640
when preparing our image and we'll talk more about exactly what that base image is doing for us in just

01:55.640 --> 01:56.210
a moment.

01:57.230 --> 02:01.010
On the next one, we said we want to run this command.

02:01.010 --> 02:04.310
This command was the argument that was provided to the instruction.

02:04.310 --> 02:06.500
And then for CMD down here at the bottom.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.460
Well I bet you can guess.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.500
Yeah that is the argument to CMD.

02:09.920 --> 02:10.250
All right.

02:10.250 --> 02:15.350
So that's what was going on with the overall structure of the Docker file, but that doesn't really

02:15.350 --> 02:20.690
explain a lot of the pieces or kind of like what the intent of each of these lines were outside of the

02:20.690 --> 02:24.080
comments that we added on there while we were writing the Docker file.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.460
So let's take a quick pause.

02:25.460 --> 02:29.000
We're going to come back the next section and we're going to start to look at the output that we got

02:29.000 --> 02:35.240
inside of our terminal and try to understand how each of those lines of configuration was interpreted

02:35.540 --> 02:38.330
by the Docker server and used to build our image.

02:38.330 --> 02:40.400
So quick break and I'll see you in just a minute.
