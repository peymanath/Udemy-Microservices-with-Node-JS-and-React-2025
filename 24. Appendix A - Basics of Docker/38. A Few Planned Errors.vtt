WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:04.710
In the last section, we put together the core of the Node.js web application.

00:04.920 --> 00:09.240
If you didn't follow along in the last section and you just copy paste of the code, just make sure

00:09.240 --> 00:13.320
that you've got your indexed JS file and a packaged JSON file.

00:13.350 --> 00:18.270
You'll also want to make sure that you've got your terminal open inside of your project directory.

00:18.270 --> 00:23.850
And so if I list out my current files and folders, I should see the indexes and packaged JSON files.

00:24.900 --> 00:29.100
So we've got some source code here and now we need to figure out how we can wrap this all up inside

00:29.100 --> 00:30.480
of a Docker container.

00:30.660 --> 00:35.490
I want to first begin by telling you a little bit about Node.js and how we're going to start up this

00:35.490 --> 00:36.330
application.

00:36.690 --> 00:42.570
So just in case you've never made use of Node before to commands that you need to be aware of to install

00:42.570 --> 00:44.940
dependencies and start up this application.

00:45.390 --> 00:51.030
Any time that we want to start up a node app, we have to first install a set of dependencies and we

00:51.030 --> 00:57.060
can install all of our dependencies by running a command NPM install inside of our project directory.

00:57.300 --> 01:03.240
This starts up a little program called NPM, which is somewhat colloquially known as the Node package

01:03.240 --> 01:03.960
manager.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.040
This is going to run that program and install a couple of dependencies for us.

01:08.040 --> 01:13.350
And of course it assumes that NPM is installed on our local machine or inside the container, as the

01:13.350 --> 01:14.160
case may be.

01:15.360 --> 01:19.830
The other thing to be aware of is that we're going to have to eventually start our server up and to

01:19.830 --> 01:23.700
do so we're going to run the command and PM start at the terminal as well.

01:23.880 --> 01:27.870
And again, this also kind of assumes that NPM is already installed.

01:28.410 --> 01:28.800
All right.

01:28.800 --> 01:33.180
So with all this in mind, let's now start thinking about the Docker file that we have to put together.

01:33.210 --> 01:38.160
Now, the series of operations that we are going to put into the Docker file is going to end up looking

01:38.160 --> 01:41.130
very similar to what we did in the last application.

01:41.460 --> 01:47.010
So in this somewhat complicated diagram, our template that we're kind of following here for our Docker

01:47.010 --> 01:53.550
file is to specify a base image, run some command to install some dependencies, which definitely sounds

01:53.550 --> 01:58.950
like something we have to do and then specify the command to run on startup, which as we just discussed,

01:58.950 --> 02:00.600
is that NPM start thing.

02:01.530 --> 02:07.440
Now over when we were working on the reddest image, we said from Alpine to specify the base image we

02:07.440 --> 02:13.290
ran apk add red is to install the dependency and then we set up the default command as a server.

02:13.290 --> 02:17.790
And so it really seems like we have some very direct parallels this time around.

02:17.820 --> 02:23.220
I think that for the node application, we could probably do a Docker file that specifies Alpine as

02:23.220 --> 02:24.210
our base image.

02:24.210 --> 02:29.940
We can then run NPM install to install all of our dependencies, and then we can set up the default

02:29.940 --> 02:34.710
command of NPM, start to run the server when the container first comes online.

02:35.070 --> 02:39.450
So we're going to take this type of approach right here by creating a Docker file and then essentially

02:39.450 --> 02:42.780
putting almost exactly these instructions inside of it.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.430
Now quick disclaimer.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.020
Just quick disclaimer here.

02:46.020 --> 02:51.510
Remember I had said we're going to do a few things here slightly wrong, just so you can see some very

02:51.510 --> 02:57.390
common error messages that you are just about guaranteed to see on your own personal projects.

02:57.390 --> 03:02.550
So maybe in this discussion or the series of steps that I just described, there might be something

03:02.550 --> 03:07.380
in here that doesn't quite line up with what's reality or what we really have to do.

03:08.840 --> 03:09.080
All right.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.020
So let's get started.

03:10.040 --> 03:16.310
I'm going to begin by making sure I've got my code editor open based on that simple Web directory.

03:16.310 --> 03:20.000
And inside of here, I'm going to make a new Docker file.

03:20.510 --> 03:25.220
Remember, it's Docker with a capital D and there is no file extension on there.

03:25.580 --> 03:29.570
Then inside of here, we're going to first specify our base image.

03:29.570 --> 03:34.400
And just to be really complete, I'm going to add in some comments for these steps just to remind you

03:34.400 --> 03:36.240
what we're doing every step along the way.

03:36.260 --> 03:40.070
So I'll say specify a base image.

03:40.070 --> 03:40.850
And you know what?

03:40.850 --> 03:42.680
Let's use that Alpine image again.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.080
It really seemed like it worked out last time for us.

03:46.260 --> 03:50.610
Next up, we're going to install some dependencies.

03:52.480 --> 03:55.710
To do so we will have run the command NPM install.

03:55.720 --> 04:01.120
Like I just said, the NPM install command is how we install dependencies on a Node.js project.

04:01.480 --> 04:07.990
And then finally we will set up a default command which we can do by running out CMD and then we put

04:07.990 --> 04:14.050
down a set of square brackets and then in a set of double quotes, we separately list out all the parts

04:14.050 --> 04:17.710
of the command that we want to run when the container is first created.

04:17.860 --> 04:22.480
And so to start up our server, we are probably going to want NPM start like.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.140
So notice that I've got a comma between those two strings.

04:27.850 --> 04:28.180
All right.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.420
I think this looks pretty good.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.160
It definitely looks very similar to what we did for Redis.

04:32.170 --> 04:38.440
So let's now flip back over to our terminal and see what happens when we try to build this image.

04:39.100 --> 04:44.590
So I'm going to list out my files and folders and verify that I now see the Docker file inside of here.

04:44.710 --> 04:51.130
And then remember to build an image we can run, Docker build, and then we put the dot in there to

04:51.130 --> 04:54.430
specify the build context of the current directory.

04:55.330 --> 05:00.460
So I'll run that and then we very quickly see NPM not found.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.120
All right.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.750
So first problem of a couple that we're going to see.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.490
So let's take a quick pause right here.

05:05.500 --> 05:10.000
We're going to start to investigate why we are seeing this error and fix it up.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.070
So a quick break and I'll see you in just a minute.
