00:00.580 --> 00:07.170
In the last section we ran the Docker PS Command and we saw one variation of it which was Docker, PS

00:07.210 --> 00:08.680
Dash all.

00:09.010 --> 00:14.050
When we ran Dash, Dash all on here, we saw that we got a print up of all the containers we'd ever

00:14.050 --> 00:18.730
started up on our machine, which is kind of interesting because it kind of begs the question, when

00:18.730 --> 00:21.730
does a container really get shut down?

00:21.730 --> 00:23.200
Why does it get shut down?

00:23.200 --> 00:25.420
And what happens when it gets shut down?

00:25.450 --> 00:30.670
So starting this section, I want to start to show you a little bit around the life cycle of a container

00:30.670 --> 00:36.010
which is going to give you a better idea of what's going on behind the scenes now before first investigating

00:36.010 --> 00:40.270
or just jumping to the end, like figuring out what happens when a container gets shut down.

00:40.270 --> 00:44.800
I want to kind of go all the way to the start and really figure out what happens when a container is

00:44.800 --> 00:45.940
first created.

00:46.480 --> 00:51.400
Now, we've learned at this point that to start up a new container from an image, we use the Docker

00:51.400 --> 00:52.390
run command.

00:52.390 --> 00:57.310
But when we looked at this diagram, remember we looked at this diagram like two or three sections ago,

00:57.370 --> 01:00.820
you'll notice that I put some very particular terminology here.

01:00.820 --> 01:04.510
I said, Creating and running a container.

01:04.870 --> 01:10.090
Creating a container and actually starting it up are actually two separate processes.

01:11.320 --> 01:16.810
So there's actually two additional commands in addition to Docker run that we can use to start up a

01:16.810 --> 01:17.800
new container.

01:18.700 --> 01:25.300
Docker run, running that at your command line is identical to running two other commands together.

01:25.330 --> 01:28.450
First Docker Create and then Docker start.

01:28.510 --> 01:34.510
As you might guess, the Docker Create Commands is used to create a container out of an image and then

01:34.510 --> 01:37.030
start is used to actually start an image.

01:37.120 --> 01:41.170
But at this point you might be a little bit curious of, Hey, what's the distinction between creating

01:41.170 --> 01:43.720
a container and actually starting a container?

01:43.770 --> 01:46.930
Let's look at a diagram that's going to help you understand the differences between the two.

01:47.470 --> 01:50.170
So we've looked at a diagram like this several times before.

01:50.260 --> 01:55.030
Remember, on our image over here, we've got that kind of file system snapshot of sorts, and we've

01:55.030 --> 01:56.710
also got a start up command.

01:57.810 --> 02:04.200
The process of creating a container is where we kind of take the file system in here and kind of prep

02:04.200 --> 02:06.390
it for use in this new container.

02:06.840 --> 02:12.480
When we create the container, we're just talking about kind of prepping or setting up this file system

02:12.480 --> 02:17.290
snapshot to be used to create the container to actually start the container.

02:17.310 --> 02:22.530
That's when we actually execute this start up command that might start up the process of like hello

02:22.530 --> 02:26.600
world or in the case of that busy box one that we used the echo.

02:26.610 --> 02:27.350
Hi there.

02:27.360 --> 02:30.600
Or whatever process is supposed to be executed inside the container.

02:30.780 --> 02:35.070
So again, creating a container is about the file system starting.

02:35.070 --> 02:38.220
It is about actually executing the startup command.

02:38.460 --> 02:42.480
So with that in mind, let's try flipping over to our command line really quickly and we're going to

02:42.480 --> 02:46.770
start to investigate the differences between creating a container and starting a container.

02:48.150 --> 02:49.890
Over at my my command line.

02:49.890 --> 02:56.610
I'm going to first try running the Docker, create and start commands with the Hello World image.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.740
So I will first do Docker.

02:59.570 --> 03:02.090
Creates Hello World.

03:02.630 --> 03:06.390
When I run that command, I get this long string of characters printed out.

03:06.410 --> 03:10.310
This is the ID of the container that was just created.

03:10.670 --> 03:18.140
I can now actually execute the Hello World Command inside of this container by running Docker start.

03:18.140 --> 03:20.930
And I'm going to add on a little argument here.

03:20.930 --> 03:24.140
I'm going to say Dash a we'll talk about what that is in just a second.

03:24.410 --> 03:28.070
And then I'm going to paste the ID that was just emitted right here.

03:28.070 --> 03:31.130
So I'm going to paste in that really long series of characters.

03:31.250 --> 03:35.270
And then when I run this command, we'll see that familiar welcome message up.

03:36.140 --> 03:37.270
So what happened here?

03:37.280 --> 03:41.810
Well, again, first off, we kind of prepped the container by getting that file system ready.

03:42.200 --> 03:47.870
Then after that, we actually executed the primary start up command in there with Docker start.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.960
Now, what was with the dash right there?

03:49.970 --> 03:54.770
Well, to show you what's going on with that, let's try running Docker start again, but without the

03:54.770 --> 03:55.460
dash.

03:56.990 --> 04:02.150
So I'm going to run Docker Start and then I'm going to again paste in oops, I lost the thing.

04:02.150 --> 04:04.940
I've got to do the create again very quickly.

04:07.120 --> 04:11.650
So there's my ID and I'll do Docker start, but without the dash this time.

04:12.340 --> 04:18.640
So when I run Docker start, you'll notice that I just see the ID, the dash, a command is what's going

04:18.640 --> 04:24.090
to make docker actually watch for output from the container and print it out to your terminal.

04:24.100 --> 04:29.770
So the dash specifically means, hey, kind of attached to the container, so to speak, and watch for

04:29.770 --> 04:33.160
output coming from it and print it out at my terminal.

04:33.460 --> 04:38.710
So when I put on Docker start dash, that means give me any output that is coming from that thing.

04:38.830 --> 04:40.750
And when I run that boom, there it is.

04:40.960 --> 04:46.420
So you'll notice that's a very small difference between Docker run and Docker start by default.

04:46.420 --> 04:51.790
Docker Run is going to show you all the logs or all the information coming out of the container by default.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.320
Docker start is the opposite.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.830
Docker Start is not going to show you information coming out of the terminal.

04:58.290 --> 04:58.620
All right.

04:58.620 --> 05:03.930
So that's a differences between Docker run and Docker Start and Docker create.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.340
Let's take a quick pause right here.

05:05.340 --> 05:09.450
We're going to come back to the next section and we'll talk a little bit more about exactly what it

05:09.450 --> 05:13.710
meant when we saw with the Docker piece all that exited status.

05:13.710 --> 05:15.930
So a quick break and I'll see you in just a minute.
