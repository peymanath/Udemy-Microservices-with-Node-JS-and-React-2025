00:00.780 --> 00:05.640
In the last section, we made a little change to our Docker file and then tried rebuilding the image.

00:05.670 --> 00:11.100
The good news is that NPM is now clearly being included inside of our container, and so it's attempting

00:11.100 --> 00:12.540
to install dependencies.

00:12.570 --> 00:18.390
However, NPM itself very quickly threw out a error message right here, complaining that there is no

00:18.390 --> 00:21.300
file called package JSON available.

00:21.660 --> 00:26.250
Now, just in case you weren't around or you kind of skipped over the section where we put together

00:26.250 --> 00:31.060
the package JSON file together, that is a file inside of our project directory right here.

00:31.080 --> 00:35.970
Its purpose is to list out all the different dependencies that are required to successfully run our

00:35.970 --> 00:36.720
project.

00:36.810 --> 00:41.070
So when we run NPM, install, NPM is going to try to find this file.

00:41.100 --> 00:45.810
It's going to find all the dependencies that are listed, and then it's going to try to install each

00:45.810 --> 00:46.500
of those.

00:47.260 --> 00:51.300
So clearly the issue here is that MPM is not finding that file.

00:51.310 --> 00:53.080
So let's talk about why it is.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.040
All right.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.030
So a quick diagram.

00:56.110 --> 00:57.730
We've looked at this one before.

00:58.180 --> 00:59.950
We've got our container on the right hand side.

00:59.950 --> 01:02.140
We've got the steps out of our Docker file.

01:02.140 --> 01:07.270
And then down here is a little representation of the node alpine image that we're making use of.

01:07.600 --> 01:12.700
So let's imagine what is going on inside of our image building process right now.

01:12.730 --> 01:19.150
First off, we specify node alpine that downloads the Alpine image or the node image to be precise.

01:19.150 --> 01:23.770
And then the next step starts up and it says, okay, I'm going to go back to the previous step and

01:23.770 --> 01:27.070
get the image from there and then create a temporary container out of it.

01:27.070 --> 01:32.620
So as soon as run NPM install starts to boot up, we can imagine that we take this file system snapshot

01:32.620 --> 01:41.500
right here and we kind of put it into this very temporary container and then we execute NPM install.

01:41.590 --> 01:43.600
Now, I got a quick question for you.

01:43.630 --> 01:46.660
Do you see anywhere inside of this file system right here?

01:46.660 --> 01:48.910
Do you see a package, JSON file?

01:49.030 --> 01:50.230
Well, the answer is no.

01:50.440 --> 01:55.330
There is no package JSON file available inside of the container.

01:55.540 --> 02:02.230
The only files and folders that are available inside the container is exactly whatever came out of the

02:02.230 --> 02:02.920
file system.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.320
Snapshot from the node image.

02:06.100 --> 02:11.700
Remember, we are only working with a segment of our hard drive inside this container.

02:11.710 --> 02:14.920
There's this entire other rest of the hard drive.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.250
Kind of like not connected inside this container.

02:18.250 --> 02:23.770
And somewhere inside the rest of the hard drive is where our packaged JSON file is, and that is not

02:23.770 --> 02:27.100
at all being communicated into the container.

02:27.100 --> 02:33.730
And so we do successfully run NPM install, but there just plain is no packaged JSON file available.

02:34.090 --> 02:39.040
So the takeaway here is that when you are building an image, none of the files inside of your project

02:39.040 --> 02:41.650
directory right here are available inside the container.

02:41.650 --> 02:46.570
By default, they are all 100% sectioned off, completely segmented out.

02:46.570 --> 02:48.190
They are not at all available.

02:48.190 --> 02:53.980
And you cannot assume that any of these files are available unless you specifically allow it inside

02:53.980 --> 02:55.090
of your Docker file.

02:55.900 --> 02:59.050
So as you might guess, that's exactly what we're going to do.

02:59.080 --> 03:04.750
We're going to add in one line of configuration to our Docker file to make sure that both our indexed

03:04.750 --> 03:11.770
JS file and packaged JSON file are available inside the container when we try to run the NPM install

03:11.770 --> 03:12.400
command.

03:12.670 --> 03:16.570
Let's take a quick pause right here and then we're going to add in that additional instruction in the

03:16.570 --> 03:17.350
next section.
