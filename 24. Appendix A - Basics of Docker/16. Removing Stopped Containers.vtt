00:00.510 --> 00:04.740
In the last section, I'd mentioned that I'd cleared out all the stopped containers on my machine,

00:04.800 --> 00:06.750
so I thought you might be curious on how I did that.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.020
If I run Docker, dash, dash.

00:09.060 --> 00:09.450
All right.

00:09.450 --> 00:12.810
Now I can see that I currently have two stopped containers.

00:12.810 --> 00:17.460
So these containers right now are essentially just taking up disk space on my computer.

00:17.460 --> 00:22.500
And so it might be to my advantage to try to entirely delete them and not just leave them in this stop

00:22.500 --> 00:27.420
state to delete all these containers I can run Docker system.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.100
Prune.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.650
Well, then we presented with a warning here.

00:32.660 --> 00:37.850
So just to be clear, this is not only going to delete stopped containers, it's also going to delete

00:37.850 --> 00:40.120
a couple of either items as well.

00:40.130 --> 00:42.260
Most notably your build cache.

00:42.260 --> 00:45.930
The build cache is any image that you have fetch from Docker Hub.

00:45.950 --> 00:51.410
So after running Docker Prune, you will have to redownload images from Docker Hub, which is not a

00:51.410 --> 00:52.270
really big deal.

00:52.280 --> 00:56.150
Just be aware that you're going to have to wait a couple of minutes the next time you start up a container.

00:56.150 --> 00:58.430
Not really a couple of minutes, but a couple of seconds, really.

00:58.700 --> 00:59.690
So we can enter in.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.460
Yes, hit enter.

01:01.580 --> 01:06.650
And then it will tell us about the deleted containers and it'll tell me also how much space has been

01:06.650 --> 01:08.990
reclaimed by deleting those resources.

01:09.080 --> 01:15.650
If I then do another Docker dash all, I'll see that I do not have any stopped containers whatsoever.

01:16.250 --> 01:22.700
I really recommend you keep the Docker system prune command in mind because any time that you're kind

01:22.700 --> 01:27.500
of done working with Docker for a period of weeks or months, or if you decide you just don't want to

01:27.500 --> 01:32.360
work with Docker again at all, you will want to run this command to delete any containers that are

01:32.360 --> 01:35.180
still just kind of sitting around eating up disk space.

01:35.690 --> 01:36.050
All right.

01:36.060 --> 01:38.750
Let's take another quick break and we'll continue in the next section.
