00:00.880 --> 00:05.050
Before we move on, there's just one last little quick thing that I want to show you around this entire

00:05.050 --> 00:06.400
image building process.

00:06.430 --> 00:10.360
Now, what I'm going to show you inside this section is not something that you're probably going to

00:10.360 --> 00:15.640
do very often or ever, really, but it's something that I thought you might find a little bit interesting

00:15.640 --> 00:20.620
and help you get a little bit of a better handle on the relationship between an image and a container.

00:21.070 --> 00:25.510
When we're going over the flow of actions that occurred while we were building the image, we spoke

00:25.510 --> 00:28.000
about how we take an image from the previous step.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.370
We create a container out of it, we do something with that container and we then essentially create

00:33.370 --> 00:39.430
an image out of that running container or that kind of very temporary temporary container that was created.

00:39.820 --> 00:45.580
So at this point, you and I know very well that we use images to create containers, but based on everything

00:45.580 --> 00:50.380
that we've been talking about in this section, it sure seems like the opposite is kind of true as well.

00:50.380 --> 00:55.090
It seems like we can kind of take a container and generate an image out of it as well.

00:55.090 --> 00:56.920
And that actually is correct.

00:56.920 --> 01:02.980
You and I can manually create a container, run some commands inside of it, or change its file system

01:02.980 --> 01:07.720
and then generate a usable image that we can then use at some point in the future.

01:07.870 --> 01:13.690
In other words, we can kind of very manually do the same thing that our Docker file does.

01:13.840 --> 01:20.140
We can create a container, run a command, like, say, apk, add Redis right here and then generate

01:20.140 --> 01:21.470
an image out of that.

01:21.490 --> 01:23.320
I want to very quickly show you how that would look.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.410
But again, I really don't expect you to do this on your own personal project.

01:26.410 --> 01:29.950
I'm just showing this as kind of something you might find interesting.

01:30.670 --> 01:34.630
So let's try to kind of emulate the Docker file that we just put together.

01:34.630 --> 01:38.320
We're going to create a new container manually out of the Alpine image.

01:38.320 --> 01:40.600
We're then going to install Redis on it.

01:40.600 --> 01:46.000
We're then going to set up a default command and generate a usable image that can be used in the future.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.580
Essentially, everything that our Docker file just did so at my terminal, I'm going to execute Docker

01:51.580 --> 01:56.170
run and we're going to start up a shell inside of here so that we can run a couple of commands inside

01:56.170 --> 01:56.650
of it.

01:56.650 --> 02:03.850
So I'm going to put on the IT flag, I'll put on Alpine as our image and then the command that I want

02:03.850 --> 02:07.030
to execute inside there is S-H to start up a shell.

02:07.660 --> 02:12.160
So then I get presented with a command prompt right here that is inside of that running container.

02:13.330 --> 02:20.650
And so inside that container I'm going to manually install Redis by running APK, add dash dash update

02:20.650 --> 02:22.270
Redis like so.

02:22.690 --> 02:29.500
So we now have a running container where we have modified its file system and the file system has now

02:29.500 --> 02:31.780
seen the installation of Redis.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.880
So we've got the running container.

02:33.910 --> 02:40.000
I'm now going to open up a second terminal window and inside of here I'm going to run a command using

02:40.000 --> 02:47.050
the Docker CLI that's going to essentially take a snapshot of that running container and assign a default

02:47.050 --> 02:50.770
command to it and generate an image out of the entire thing.

02:51.010 --> 02:58.930
So to do so, I'll say first Docker PS to get the idea of that running container and then we'll do Docker

02:59.020 --> 02:59.950
commit.

03:00.220 --> 03:06.010
I'm going to add on a dash key right here, which is going to allow us to specify the default command.

03:06.100 --> 03:09.760
So I'm going to say dash C and then I'll put in CMD.

03:11.120 --> 03:15.050
Double quotes inside the square brace readies dash server.

03:15.410 --> 03:19.370
Close the double quote a close the square brace and I'll close the single quote.

03:19.370 --> 03:23.750
So notice how we have a single quote, single quote and double quotes around it.

03:24.200 --> 03:28.550
And then after all that, I'll paste the ID of that running container.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.680
So I'm going to paste it in like so.

03:31.540 --> 03:37.420
And the output is the ID of a new image that we just customized for our own uses.

03:37.450 --> 03:40.110
Now you'll notice that this is a really long ID right here.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.570
One shortcut that I haven't quite mentioned so far.

03:42.580 --> 03:47.980
Whenever you're making use of IDs or hashes in the Docker world, you don't have to copy the entire

03:47.980 --> 03:48.460
thing.

03:48.460 --> 03:53.290
You can just copy a segment of the start, and it's kind of assumed that this is going to be unique

03:53.290 --> 03:56.980
enough that Docker is going to take this and realize that, Oh, you're probably talking about this

03:56.980 --> 03:58.450
very long ID right here.

03:58.630 --> 04:04.240
So I'm going to copy just an arbitrary number of leading characters here, and then we'll do a Docker

04:04.240 --> 04:09.970
run that, and that's going to start up a new container out of the image that we just created.

04:10.090 --> 04:15.760
And inside that running container, we already have Redis installed and the default starting command

04:15.760 --> 04:17.590
will be to run, read a server.

04:17.890 --> 04:23.300
So let's run that and we'll very quickly see all the typical output that we see from a running reddest

04:23.410 --> 04:24.250
instance.

04:24.610 --> 04:24.970
All right.

04:24.970 --> 04:31.120
So like I said, we basically just very manually created a container, added a dependency to the container,

04:31.990 --> 04:35.920
set up the default command, and then generated an image out of all that.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.220
Again, you really don't want to use that practice in general.

04:39.260 --> 04:41.620
You don't use Docker commit in general.

04:41.620 --> 04:47.020
You really want to use the Docker file approach because it allows you to very easily rerun that series

04:47.020 --> 04:48.190
of steps again in the future.

04:48.190 --> 04:52.720
But again, I just thought you might find it interesting how, yes, there really is a very kind of

04:52.720 --> 04:55.810
fluid relationship between containers and images.

04:56.200 --> 04:56.620
All right.

04:56.620 --> 05:00.280
So let's take another quick pause right here and we'll move on to the next section.
