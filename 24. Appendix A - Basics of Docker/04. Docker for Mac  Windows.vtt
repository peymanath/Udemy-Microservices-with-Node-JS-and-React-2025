00:00.450 --> 00:03.570
In the last section, we tried to answer the question, what is Docker?

00:03.570 --> 00:05.640
But we didn't really get a great explanation.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.100
We said, okay, it's a reference to a bunch of products.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.820
We then started to talk about something called an image and something called a container.

00:11.910 --> 00:16.770
At this point, we need to install some more software onto our machine so that you and I can work directly

00:16.770 --> 00:20.850
with images and containers so that we can get a better idea of how they work.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.770
So here's what you and I are going to do.

00:22.800 --> 00:28.470
We're going to be installing a piece of software called Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac, depending

00:28.470 --> 00:29.940
upon your operating system.

00:30.060 --> 00:35.130
Inside of this program are two very important tools that we're going to be making use of throughout

00:35.130 --> 00:35.970
this course.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.500
The first tool that's inside this package is something called the Docker client.

00:40.530 --> 00:45.240
The Docker client, also known as the Docker CLI, is a program that you and I are going to interact

00:45.240 --> 00:47.190
with quite a bit from our terminal.

00:47.190 --> 00:51.120
We're going to enter in commands to our terminal, issue them to Docker client.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.090
It's going to take our commands and figure out what to do with them.

00:54.330 --> 01:00.180
Now, Docker, the Docker client itself, doesn't actually do anything with containers or images.

01:00.180 --> 01:06.810
Instead, the Docker client is really just a tool or a portal of sorts to help us interact with another

01:06.810 --> 01:12.210
piece of software that is included in this Docker for Windows or Mac package called the Docker server.

01:12.450 --> 01:15.150
This is also frequently called the Docker Daemon.

01:15.390 --> 01:20.880
This program right here is the actual tool or the actual piece of software that is responsible for creating

01:20.880 --> 01:26.760
containers, images, maintaining containers, uploading images, and doing just about everything you

01:26.760 --> 01:29.430
can possibly imagine around the world of Docker.

01:29.550 --> 01:32.370
So it's the Docker client that you and I issue commands to.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.990
It's the thing that we interact with.

01:33.990 --> 01:38.250
And behind the scenes this client is interacting with the Docker server.

01:38.370 --> 01:41.880
You and I are never going to really reach directly out to this Docker server.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.550
It's something that's just kind of running behind the scenes.

01:45.060 --> 01:47.430
So again, we're going to take a quick break right now.

01:47.430 --> 01:51.330
We're going to come back the next section and we're going to start installing this package so that we

01:51.330 --> 01:54.930
can get a better sense of how to work with images and containers.

01:54.930 --> 01:57.270
So quick break and I'll see you in just a minute.
