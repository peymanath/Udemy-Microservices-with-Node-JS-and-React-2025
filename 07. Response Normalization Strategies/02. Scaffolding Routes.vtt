00:01.250 --> 00:05.780
Now that we've put together this kind of demonstration root handler inside of our current user file,

00:05.810 --> 00:10.340
we're going to make one or two small changes to it and then duplicate the setup to the other three route

00:10.340 --> 00:12.080
handling files that we already put together.

00:12.650 --> 00:15.980
The first thing I'm going to do is add in the arguments to the callback function.

00:16.430 --> 00:18.200
So rec and rez.

00:18.990 --> 00:22.500
And then inside of here, I'm going to put together the same implementation we had a little bit ago.

00:22.620 --> 00:25.140
So I'll do a resend of Hi there.

00:25.140 --> 00:25.830
Like so.

00:28.980 --> 00:29.310
Okay.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.630
So let's now take this configuration or this code.

00:32.640 --> 00:36.390
We're going to copy, paste it over to a sign in, sign out and sign up.

00:36.810 --> 00:42.120
We'll then change some of the different routes just to make sure that they all correspond to different

00:42.120 --> 00:44.430
routes that we had specified over in this diagram.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.860
So I'm going to take everything inside of here.

00:46.860 --> 00:47.910
I'm going to copy it.

00:48.360 --> 00:52.230
I'm going to go first to sign in and paste it and then save.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.140
I'll go to sign out and paste and then save.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.680
And then I'll go to sign up and paste and save.

01:00.850 --> 01:07.120
I'm then going to close current user, I'm going to close indexes and we're going to update, sign in,

01:07.120 --> 01:09.220
sign out and sign up one by one.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.420
And each of these we're just going to make sure that they have the appropriate routes and the appropriate

01:13.420 --> 01:14.530
method as well.

01:15.490 --> 01:17.380
So I'm going to first begin inside of CNN.

01:18.790 --> 01:19.410
Inside of here.

01:19.420 --> 01:21.880
I'm going to change the route to.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.820
API users sign in.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.530
I'll change the method to be opposed.

01:29.180 --> 01:32.720
And then I'll change the name of the router down here at the bottom as well.

01:33.020 --> 01:35.900
I'll change that to sign in router.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.530
I'll then save this file and close it.

01:40.690 --> 01:42.490
Next up is sign out.

01:43.120 --> 01:48.760
So inside of sign out, we will change this to a post request to API users sign out.

01:49.730 --> 01:55.340
So we'll take it to a post API users sign out.

01:55.910 --> 01:58.430
And then finally, I'm going to update the name of the router at the bottom.

01:58.820 --> 02:00.950
So sign out router.

02:03.410 --> 02:05.000
And then finally over to sign up.

02:06.590 --> 02:09.770
So this one should be a post request to API users.

02:09.770 --> 02:10.400
Sign up.

02:11.610 --> 02:14.520
So a post your API users sign up.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.180
And then very similarly, I will update the name of the router at the bottom as well.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.460
So sign up router.

02:21.950 --> 02:22.250
All right.

02:22.250 --> 02:25.460
So we've got a little bit of scaffolding put together for all four of these files.

02:25.580 --> 02:30.200
Let's now go in, associate each of these different routers with our express application back inside

02:30.200 --> 02:31.640
the index file.

02:32.730 --> 02:33.750
So back over here.

02:34.560 --> 02:40.560
Right after our current user router import, I'll add in an import for sign in router.

02:41.670 --> 02:44.310
From Roots sign in.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.540
Then sign out router.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.710
And finally sign up router.

03:01.370 --> 03:05.420
I'll then make sure that I associate each of those routers with our express application right after

03:05.420 --> 03:07.550
the current user, one that we put together down there.

03:08.150 --> 03:15.620
So we'll do an app, use sign in router and use sign out router.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.080
And an obtuse.

03:18.970 --> 03:20.590
Sign up router.

03:22.190 --> 03:25.960
We're going to be doing a lot of steps like what we just did between the last video and this one.

03:25.970 --> 03:30.230
Throughout the rest of this application where we create a set of files together and then put some similar

03:30.230 --> 03:31.730
scaffolding into each of them.

03:32.210 --> 03:36.020
The reason for this is that a lot of the code that we're going to end up writing is going to be unfortunately

03:36.020 --> 03:39.300
a little bit similar to each other, I suppose.

03:39.350 --> 03:45.110
I want to make sure that we save as much as time as possible, because honestly, we have a incredible,

03:45.290 --> 03:50.120
really an incredible amount of code to write for this application way more than you would ever expect.

03:50.150 --> 03:55.490
I just want to make sure that this all gets together in a very formulaic fashion with as few mistakes

03:55.490 --> 03:57.020
and typos as possible.

03:57.050 --> 04:00.950
And that's really easy to do if we just go through and kind of scaffold all this stuff in one go.

04:02.060 --> 04:03.130
So it's looks pretty good.

04:03.170 --> 04:03.970
Quick pause right here.

04:03.980 --> 04:05.180
Continue in just a minute.
