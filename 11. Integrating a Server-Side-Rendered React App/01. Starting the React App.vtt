00:01.070 --> 00:05.000
Our authentication service is now pretty well tested, so we're going to start to move on to the next

00:05.000 --> 00:06.470
part of our application.

00:06.890 --> 00:11.450
In this section, we're going to start to focus on building out the authentication portion, just the

00:11.450 --> 00:14.030
authentication part of our React application.

00:14.570 --> 00:19.280
Now, just as we did on our last app, if you do not want to build the React part of this thing, that

00:19.280 --> 00:20.770
is not a problem whatsoever.

00:20.780 --> 00:25.400
Maybe you are not familiar with React, maybe you just don't have any interest in the front end, whatever

00:25.400 --> 00:25.700
it is.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.100
If you don't want to build your React application, that is okay.

00:28.490 --> 00:34.340
If you don't want to build the React app, go to the last section or last video in the section and download

00:34.340 --> 00:35.810
the zip file inside there.

00:36.170 --> 00:41.630
Now, as a part of that section or that video with that zip file, there will be some text instructions

00:41.630 --> 00:42.890
for you to follow.

00:42.920 --> 00:48.050
We're going to have to make a change or two to our Kubernetes deployment to make this React application

00:48.050 --> 00:49.220
work as expected.

00:49.220 --> 00:54.500
And so you have to read the instructions inside of that text lecture just to understand how to make

00:54.500 --> 00:55.790
use of the zip file.

00:56.450 --> 00:56.660
Okay.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.990
So with all that in mind, if you want to skip the React stuff, pause the video.

00:59.990 --> 01:00.970
Now continue on.

01:00.980 --> 01:04.820
Otherwise stick around and we'll have a brief discussion of this React project.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.260
The first thing I want to do is highlight the different screens that we're going to try to put together.

01:09.830 --> 01:12.410
We're going to implement just the authentication part.

01:12.500 --> 01:17.690
So I want to build out a React application that's going to have a landing page of sorts like this right

01:17.690 --> 01:18.230
here.

01:18.350 --> 01:22.670
When a user first comes to our app, we'll go in to show them some text that says You are not signed

01:22.670 --> 01:23.060
in.

01:23.180 --> 01:27.860
And the header should have a button that will take the user to a sign up or a sign in page.

01:28.810 --> 01:30.790
If a user clicks on sign up, great.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.020
We'll show a sign up form.

01:32.470 --> 01:35.410
If they click on sign in, great, we'll show a sign in form.

01:35.770 --> 01:40.900
And then either way, after a user authenticates with our application, we'll then redirect them back

01:40.900 --> 01:42.340
to the landing page.

01:42.340 --> 01:46.030
And when they go back to the landing page, we should now instead show something that says you are signed

01:46.030 --> 01:49.030
in and we'll update the header up here as well.

01:50.540 --> 01:55.370
So this is going to be a pretty simple, very straightforward application, just meant to deal with

01:55.370 --> 01:56.330
authentication.

01:56.780 --> 02:00.320
So now that we understand the scope of what we're building, let's have a quick discussion about some

02:00.320 --> 02:02.060
of the technologies we're going to use for this.

02:02.060 --> 02:06.140
Because, remember, we are trying to make use of server side rendering here, which is going to complicate

02:06.140 --> 02:07.940
things just a little bit.

02:07.940 --> 02:11.150
So a quick pause and we'll start working on this thing in just a moment.
