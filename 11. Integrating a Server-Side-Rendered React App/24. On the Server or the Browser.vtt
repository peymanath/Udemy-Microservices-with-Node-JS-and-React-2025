Now that we understand that, we need to worry about this whole domain issue inside of get initial props.

00:06.110 --> 00:11.510
We need to figure out whether we are inside the browser or the server when we're trying to make a request

00:11.510 --> 00:13.880
in there so that we can adjust the domain accordingly.

00:14.060 --> 00:15.350
So how are we going to do that?

00:15.740 --> 00:20.540
Well, it turns out that nexus used to have a really convenient function that we could use to figure

00:20.540 --> 00:24.890
out very easily whether we are in a browser or server environment.

00:25.220 --> 00:30.410
However, that little function was removed recently, so instead we have to rely upon a really kind

00:30.410 --> 00:31.660
of silly fallback.

00:31.670 --> 00:35.600
As you can tell, I'm a little bit sorry that that function was removed out of next JS, but that's

00:35.600 --> 00:36.110
life.

00:36.650 --> 00:41.600
So instead of getting initial props again, we have to decide whether we are on the server or the browser.

00:41.630 --> 00:48.290
To do so, we're going to write out if type of window equals equals equals undefined.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.620
Window is an object that only exists inside the browser.

00:52.650 --> 00:56.040
The window object does not exist inside of a Node.js environment.

00:56.040 --> 01:02.630
So if the window variable is undefined inside of well, this code that is being executed somewhere,

01:02.640 --> 01:06.240
that must mean we are on the server.

01:06.810 --> 01:14.250
And so any requests that we make inside of get initial props requests should be made to HTTP.

01:14.370 --> 01:21.210
And then that whole really long URL something like what was it, ingress and ingress, dot or dash,

01:21.210 --> 01:22.230
engine x, blah, blah blah.

01:22.260 --> 01:23.250
All that other stuff.

01:24.440 --> 01:26.240
We can then add on an LS case.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.250
So if window is defined.

01:29.180 --> 01:32.060
Then that means we are on the browser.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.770
And requests can be made.

01:35.670 --> 01:36.390
To.

01:37.350 --> 01:44.580
HTTP or really we can we can say can be made with a base URL of just empty string.

01:44.580 --> 01:50.280
And again, we'll rely upon the browser to put on the base domain or the base URL for us.

01:50.760 --> 01:51.480
So that's it.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.940
That's how we're going to decide whether we are on the server or the client.

01:54.840 --> 01:58.650
So now that we've established this quick pause right here, come back the next video and we're going

01:58.650 --> 02:01.110
to finally, finally make our request.
