00:00.800 --> 00:03.760
In this video, we're going to start to work on our sign in page.

00:03.770 --> 00:07.100
Now, the sign in page is going to be basically identical to sign up.

00:07.340 --> 00:10.460
The only big difference is here is pretty much the label at the very top.

00:10.460 --> 00:12.800
So it needs to say sign in instead of sign up.

00:13.040 --> 00:16.760
And the only other big difference is going to be the URL that we make our request to.

00:16.790 --> 00:21.890
We need to make a request to API user sign in as opposed to API users sign up.

00:22.370 --> 00:26.750
Now, if this was a course that was focused on React JS, I would probably show you how to create a

00:26.750 --> 00:29.540
single reusable component to display both these forms.

00:29.540 --> 00:34.340
But because React isn't really our focus here, we're really just going to pretty much copy, paste,

00:34.340 --> 00:38.120
sign up and then change the label and the URL that we're making the request to.

00:38.150 --> 00:39.080
That's pretty much it.

00:39.380 --> 00:40.400
So let's get to it.

00:41.180 --> 00:42.290
Back inside my editor.

00:43.740 --> 00:45.330
I'll find the pages directory.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.940
You'll notice I still have banana jars inside of here.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.110
I'm going to delete banana.

00:49.110 --> 00:50.730
That was just a quick little test.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.990
I'll then go ahead and make a copy of Sign Up.

00:54.950 --> 00:58.310
So I can either attempt to duplicate it if your editor has that option.

00:59.180 --> 00:59.540
For me.

00:59.540 --> 01:02.840
I'm going to go ahead and copy it and paste the file directly in there.

01:03.110 --> 01:04.520
So here's a copy of Sign Up.

01:05.090 --> 01:07.430
I'll then rename that to sign in.

01:09.020 --> 01:14.570
Then inside of the sign and file, all we really have to do is find where we make our request or set

01:14.570 --> 01:15.800
up the user request hook.

01:16.010 --> 01:19.100
I'll change the URL right here to sign in.

01:21.600 --> 01:26.700
And then I'll go down to my ex and I'll change sign up to sign in.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.660
I think we probably also need to update the button at the bottom.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.540
We need to make sure that says sign in as well.

01:34.530 --> 01:35.760
And I think that should be it.

01:36.410 --> 01:37.430
So I'll save this.

01:38.090 --> 01:39.290
I'm going to flip back over.

01:40.510 --> 01:44.230
And now I should be able to navigate to off sign in.

01:45.270 --> 01:46.650
And there's our sign in form.

01:47.830 --> 01:52.420
So at this point in time, I would encourage you to make sure that your application tab go to cookies,

01:52.420 --> 01:53.930
make sure you don't have any cookie.

01:53.950 --> 01:56.080
So right now, I'm definitely not authenticated.

01:56.380 --> 02:00.910
I'll then go over to the network tab and I'm going to attempt to sign in with an account that I created

02:00.910 --> 02:01.720
in the past.

02:01.930 --> 02:07.720
Now, if you do not remember any valid email address or password combination that you have created before,

02:07.780 --> 02:10.300
make sure you go back over to sign up really quickly.

02:10.450 --> 02:12.070
Sign up for a new account.

02:13.540 --> 02:15.310
With some credentials you can remember.

02:15.790 --> 02:19.210
Go and clear your cookie and then come back over to sign in.

02:20.660 --> 02:24.080
So I remember my credentials that I set up way long ago.

02:24.110 --> 02:30.470
I created a account with Test ten at Test and a password of password.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.310
So now if I go to network, I should be able to click on sign in.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.730
See the request is issued.

02:34.760 --> 02:39.440
I got redirected back to the main page and I am now considered to be signed in and I can further confirm

02:39.440 --> 02:44.270
that by going to application, looking at my cookie list and making sure I've got my cookies set as

02:44.270 --> 02:44.750
well.

02:45.670 --> 02:46.990
Well, that's pretty much it for sign in.

02:47.020 --> 02:48.280
Yeah, not that bad.

02:48.550 --> 02:52.390
As I've said many times, the first time that we go through a lot of these different topics, it takes

02:52.390 --> 02:53.350
forever.

02:53.350 --> 02:57.640
But then once we kind of get the idea of what's going on, put it together, the rest starts to go really

02:57.640 --> 02:58.210
quickly.

02:59.280 --> 02:59.670
All right.

02:59.670 --> 03:00.520
So that looks pretty good.

03:00.540 --> 03:04.650
We've got sign up, sign in and our content on the landing page.

03:04.800 --> 03:09.240
But of course, now we need to make sure that our header gets created as well.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.640
So let's take a stab at that header in the next video.
