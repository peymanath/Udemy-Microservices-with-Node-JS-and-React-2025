00:00.670 --> 00:05.710
After a lot of work, we've now finally got this information about whether or not we are signed in inside

00:05.710 --> 00:06.880
of our landing page.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.480
The last thing we need to do is take a look at that current user prop.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.400
If it is equal to null, we need to print out.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.770
You are not signed in and if it is equal to, well, anything, some kind of object as an ID or email

00:17.770 --> 00:19.210
inside of it, then we will print out.

00:19.210 --> 00:20.290
You are signed in.

00:20.590 --> 00:22.930
So let's flip back over and give this a shot.

00:23.470 --> 00:25.030
Here's my landing page stuff.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.770
So I'm going to delete everything that's inside there right now, and I'll put in just a very simple,

00:29.770 --> 00:30.940
ternary expression.

00:30.940 --> 00:31.900
So I'm going to return.

00:32.690 --> 00:33.530
Current user.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.470
If that thing is defined, I will show.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.850
How about an h one?

00:39.180 --> 00:41.520
That says you are signed in.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.000
Otherwise an H1.

00:45.260 --> 00:48.530
That says you are not signed in.

00:49.840 --> 00:54.280
And actually we could probably just return a simple h one and then use the ternary expression inside.

00:54.490 --> 00:55.780
But I'll leave that up to you.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.890
So I'm going to save that bullet back over.

00:59.820 --> 01:01.950
And I will see that I am, in fact, signed in.

01:02.920 --> 01:03.330
Cool.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.690
Now, if you want to test this out with us being signed out, well, we don't really have the ability

01:07.690 --> 01:12.970
to sign out of our application yet, but we can manually tell our application to sign ourselves out.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.290
Let me show you what I mean.

01:14.710 --> 01:16.630
Inside of my chrome developer console.

01:16.780 --> 01:21.610
I'm going to open up the very last little tab over here and find the one marked application.

01:23.110 --> 01:23.770
Inside of here.

01:23.770 --> 01:26.560
I'm going to find on the left hand nav cookies.

01:27.740 --> 01:30.440
I should be able to expand cookies like so.

01:31.430 --> 01:35.570
Select this domain and it will show the cookie that is set for this domain.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.330
So I can select that and then clear all.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.960
And now we should not have any cookie tied to ticketing dev.

01:42.290 --> 01:45.770
So if I now attempt to refresh, I will see you are not signed in.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.440
Well, let's say this is looking like it's working out pretty well.

01:49.070 --> 01:53.840
Okay, well, that's pretty much it for handling this kind of login page or the main landing page.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.020
We still have to take care of the header and the sign in page as well.

01:57.020 --> 01:58.880
So still a little bit of work left.

01:59.180 --> 02:01.310
Quick pause right here and we'll continue in just a moment.
