00:01.010 --> 00:02.750
Our header is coming along nicely.

00:02.750 --> 00:09.080
So now all we need to do is replace that little kind of not so great expression right there with a variety

00:09.080 --> 00:10.660
of different elements.

00:10.670 --> 00:13.550
Each of these lies is going to try to display a different link.

00:13.550 --> 00:16.910
So in total, we're going to eventually have kind of three lies right there.

00:16.910 --> 00:20.420
One will be to sign out and then one for sign in and one for sign up.

00:20.840 --> 00:25.550
And we can definitely write out these lies right here and try to figure out how to kind of continually

00:25.550 --> 00:28.940
toggle the visibility of each of them based on current user.

00:29.030 --> 00:33.380
But rather than writing that all out right here and ending up with a lot of really messy gsx, I want

00:33.380 --> 00:38.150
to show you a little trick that I have for whenever we want to render a collection or kind of a list

00:38.150 --> 00:41.150
of elements and then conditionally show or hide some of them.

00:41.150 --> 00:43.310
So here's my little trick up.

00:43.310 --> 00:47.720
At the very top of this function, I'm going to define a new variable called links.

00:48.320 --> 00:49.820
This is going to be an array.

00:50.150 --> 00:56.690
And in each of these, so each index inside of here, I'm going to define an object that has a label.

00:57.780 --> 01:00.770
The first one I'll give sign up and then an F.

01:00.780 --> 01:05.340
So this is going to be a location that I want to navigate to or sign up.

01:05.340 --> 01:08.190
Are RF would be off slash sign up.

01:08.900 --> 01:13.760
I'm going to do find two more objects very similar to this for sign in and sign out.

01:13.910 --> 01:15.320
So I'll do one for.

01:16.340 --> 01:17.720
Sign in.

01:20.100 --> 01:20.850
Sign in.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.190
And then finally at one four.

01:25.780 --> 01:27.010
Sign out.

01:28.660 --> 01:31.320
So slash, slash, sign out.

01:31.330 --> 01:36.370
We have not put together a sign out page just yet, so this link will probably not work just yet, but

01:36.370 --> 01:38.200
definitely the first you really should.

01:38.800 --> 01:43.540
So now that we've got this array of links, here's the real trick I want to conditionally toggle whether

01:43.540 --> 01:44.890
or not these things are visible.

01:45.130 --> 01:50.830
So to do so, I'm going to put the expression to decide whether to show each of these right before each

01:50.830 --> 01:51.700
of these objects.

01:51.700 --> 01:52.780
Let me show you what I mean.

01:53.110 --> 01:56.920
I only want to show sign up if the current user is equal to null.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.250
Because remember, if the user does not signed in, current user will be equal to null.

02:00.370 --> 02:04.450
So I'm going to say if not current user.

02:06.270 --> 02:07.190
And.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.400
And then the object.

02:09.060 --> 02:12.330
So if current user is equal to null, we're going to take the opposite of that.

02:12.330 --> 02:13.410
That gives us true.

02:13.410 --> 02:17.130
And so this first array entry is going to end up with that object right there.

02:17.550 --> 02:19.140
I'll then do the same thing for the next one.

02:21.430 --> 02:26.710
And then finally, for the last one right here, I only want to show this link or show something related

02:26.710 --> 02:29.170
to sign out if the current user is signed in.

02:29.170 --> 02:35.500
So if the current user is truthful, so say current user and and then put that object.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.200
Now, the result of this is going to be either.

02:40.110 --> 02:40.620
False.

02:40.620 --> 02:41.460
False.

02:41.550 --> 02:43.860
And that object right there.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.250
That would be the case in which I am signed in.

02:49.710 --> 02:54.870
And then the only other scenario that we could have would be these first two objects for the first indices

02:54.870 --> 02:56.730
and then false as the last one.

02:56.730 --> 02:59.490
So it would look something like that right there.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.070
So now we've got that array put together.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.800
We're going to map over it or we're going to first filter.

03:06.800 --> 03:11.720
So for each of these indices, we're only going to keep these indices that are not falsely.

03:11.810 --> 03:12.950
So I'm going to say.

03:13.890 --> 03:21.030
Link config and I'll just return link config that's going to figure out or filter out any entries in

03:21.030 --> 03:22.260
there that are false.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.770
And then for all the remaining entries, I'm going to map over each one.

03:28.690 --> 03:32.770
So for this mapping function, the argument to it is going to be these objects.

03:33.370 --> 03:40.750
So I'll structure out, label and ref, and then inside of here I will build up in return my lie.

03:42.610 --> 03:44.770
I'm going to assign a key for the key property.

03:44.770 --> 03:49.510
I'll use the ref of each link and then for right now, rather than worrying about getting any actual

03:49.510 --> 03:53.200
links inside of here or something like that, let's just print out the label so that you can see how

03:53.200 --> 03:54.940
this links thing actually works.

03:55.210 --> 03:59.620
So inside of here, I'm going to put in link or not link, but label.

04:01.150 --> 04:05.020
And then finally, I'm going to show links inside the UL down here.

04:05.720 --> 04:06.970
So there's the UL.

04:07.150 --> 04:08.500
I'll show links right there.

04:09.410 --> 04:09.700
Okay.

04:09.710 --> 04:10.520
Let's save this.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.110
Flip back over and see how we're doing.

04:13.220 --> 04:18.620
So in refresh and I'll see that I've got sign up and sign in visible when I am not signed in.

04:19.690 --> 04:24.250
If I attempt to go to all sign up and sign up for new account.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.460
Now that will change to just be sign out.

04:28.940 --> 04:35.660
So again, just a little trick to conditionally show content based upon a kind of single filtering criteria

04:35.660 --> 04:36.410
of sorts.

04:36.980 --> 04:37.280
All right.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.480
Let's continue working on this thing.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.880
So we're going to put a little bit more detail into this lie.

04:41.360 --> 04:45.080
On the lie itself, I'm going to put in a class name of nav item.

04:47.430 --> 04:49.770
I'm going to give myself a little bit of space inside.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.850
I want to have an actual link inside of here.

04:52.850 --> 04:54.910
So remember how we create links with next DJs.

04:54.950 --> 04:57.950
We have to use that link thing and then anchor element inside.

04:58.250 --> 05:02.840
So around the label I'm going to place a link with an H ref of a ref.

05:05.440 --> 05:11.470
And then around the label itself, I will place an anchor tag with the class name of NAV Link.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.140
Annika is off the anchor tag.

05:15.350 --> 05:15.640
Okay.

05:15.650 --> 05:16.550
Let's save this.

05:16.910 --> 05:17.780
Look back over.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.060
All right, so there's our link.

05:20.060 --> 05:23.270
When I hover over it, you can see the correct link at the bottom left of your browser.

05:24.560 --> 05:30.050
And if I manually sign out once again by clearing my cookie and refresh, I'll now see sign up and sign

05:30.050 --> 05:32.240
in so I can click to go to sign up.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.860
I can click to go to sign in.

05:34.490 --> 05:34.850
All right.

05:34.850 --> 05:36.170
As that's working pretty well.

05:37.120 --> 05:37.420
Okay.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.270
Well, our header is looking good with the exception of.

05:40.270 --> 05:42.850
We can't really sign out just yet.

05:43.450 --> 05:45.070
I can sign up.

05:48.120 --> 05:52.050
But now I should be able to click on, sign out and have that actually do something.

05:52.050 --> 05:53.580
Right now I just get a 404.

05:54.000 --> 05:54.780
So we're almost there.

05:54.780 --> 05:58.110
But just a little bit more quick pause right here and continue in just a moment.
