00:01.260 --> 00:01.830
In this video.

00:01.830 --> 00:04.620
We're going to start working on our sign up form right here.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.920
We're not going to worry about the header at the top right now.

00:06.930 --> 00:09.510
We're really just going to worry about the form right there.

00:09.870 --> 00:16.440
I want to be able to see this component any time I go to a URL like ticketing dev, slash off, slash

00:16.470 --> 00:17.170
sign up.

00:17.190 --> 00:21.420
So if we go to that root right there, I want to see the sign up component up here on the screen.

00:21.870 --> 00:24.180
So to do so, we will go back over to our editor.

00:24.510 --> 00:29.280
We'll find our pages directory and we'll create a new folder inside there called Off.

00:30.210 --> 00:34.140
And then inside there, we'll make a new file called Sign Up JJ's.

00:35.020 --> 00:41.410
So by defining a folder and putting a sign up file inside there, that is going to define the root of

00:41.710 --> 00:44.500
all sign up inside of our next application.

00:45.450 --> 00:49.770
So now all we have to do is define and export a react component from this file.

00:49.770 --> 00:54.480
And then if we go to sign up, we will see the contents of that component up here on the screen.

00:54.780 --> 00:57.680
So let's try it out right now inside of sign up JS.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.430
I will export default.

01:01.530 --> 01:03.150
And I will return inside of here.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.200
A form.

01:05.210 --> 01:10.640
And for right now, I'm just going to put an H one inside that says sign up.

01:11.120 --> 01:15.380
We're going to come back in just a moment and add in some buttons and inputs and labels and whatnot.

01:15.380 --> 01:18.830
But let's just say this right now and do a quick test back inside of our browser.

01:19.810 --> 01:24.790
Flip back over and I'm going to try to navigate to ticketing dev auth sign up.

01:25.700 --> 01:26.510
And there we go.

01:27.220 --> 01:32.140
So again, anytime we want to have a nested route of sorts, all we have to do is create a folder and

01:32.140 --> 01:33.820
place our components inside there.

01:34.330 --> 01:34.630
All right.

01:34.630 --> 01:36.160
Let's continue with the form right here.

01:36.460 --> 01:41.020
So, like I said, we're going to add in a couple of labels, inputs and whatnot.

01:42.170 --> 01:47.300
Right after that h one I'm going to put in a div with the class name of form group.

01:50.190 --> 01:51.690
I'll then place a label.

01:52.970 --> 01:55.370
And give it the text email address.

01:56.790 --> 02:01.320
And then an input with the class name of form dash control.

02:04.350 --> 02:04.430
Yeah.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.080
So this will show our label and input for the email.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.290
We want to do something very similar for the password as well.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.580
Just to save a little bit of time.

02:11.580 --> 02:15.060
I'm going to copy that entire div and paste it underneath itself.

02:15.060 --> 02:18.420
Then I'll change the label to password.

02:19.500 --> 02:25.020
And on input, I'll add in a type to this thing of password just to obfuscate any text that gets typed

02:25.020 --> 02:25.710
inside there.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.020
And then finally after those two, Divs, I'm going to place a button.

02:31.690 --> 02:33.340
Oh, get this in text like sign up.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.250
Also get the button.

02:35.250 --> 02:38.760
A class name of BTN Eaton Dash Primary.

02:41.500 --> 02:41.800
All right.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.360
So that is our signup form.

02:44.880 --> 02:49.980
Once you've got this all put together, we'll save it and then flip back over and we should see something

02:49.980 --> 02:51.210
like this appear on the screen.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.290
Perfect.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.310
Now, you might notice that I've got some icons here on the right hand side.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.530
Those are coming from my password manager that I'm running inside of Chrome.

02:58.710 --> 03:02.240
So if you do not see those icons, that is 100% to be expected.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.180
Do not sweat it.

03:04.560 --> 03:04.890
All right.

03:04.890 --> 03:09.270
Well, now that we've got the basics of this form put together, let's take a pause right here and continue

03:09.270 --> 03:11.310
adding in some functionality in just a moment.
