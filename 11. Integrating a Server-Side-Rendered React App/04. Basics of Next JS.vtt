00:01.380 --> 00:04.530
Let's get started doing some setup for this next jazz project.

00:04.560 --> 00:08.940
Now, all we really have to do is install a couple of dependencies, write out a script or two, and

00:08.940 --> 00:10.470
that's how we get started with next JS.

00:10.500 --> 00:14.820
There's no real generator or anything like that that we have to run or install.

00:15.330 --> 00:17.520
So I'm going to get started by going over to my terminal.

00:17.850 --> 00:20.520
I'm going to make sure I'm inside of my ticketing directory.

00:21.870 --> 00:24.060
I'm going to create a new folder inside this directory.

00:24.780 --> 00:25.800
Called Client.

00:26.940 --> 00:32.730
I'll then change into client and I'm going to generate a packaged JSON file inside there by running

00:32.730 --> 00:33.750
90 minute dash.

00:33.750 --> 00:34.290
Why?

00:36.690 --> 00:38.490
There's my packages out json file.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.890
I'm then going to install three different dependencies.

00:42.740 --> 00:44.180
I'm going to get react.

00:44.540 --> 00:45.690
React, Dom.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.000
And next.

00:49.330 --> 00:51.360
And installing these is just going to take a moment or two.

00:51.370 --> 00:55.270
So while that's running, I'm going to flip back over to my terminal or some of my code editor, and

00:55.270 --> 00:59.260
we're going to start to write out a little bit of code inside this new client directory right here.

01:00.740 --> 01:02.150
Inside the client directory.

01:02.150 --> 01:04.070
I'm going to first make a new folder.

01:04.870 --> 01:06.250
Called Pages.

01:07.680 --> 01:12.390
Inside this pages directory, we're going to end up writing out several different JavaScript files.

01:12.390 --> 01:15.990
Inside of each of these files, we are going to export a React component.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.030
Now, if you're used to making use of React, you might have used React router in the past.

01:21.150 --> 01:27.360
React router is all about setting up some routing configuration inside of a JavaScript file, but next,

01:27.360 --> 01:29.310
JSP works in a very different way.

01:29.340 --> 01:35.430
In order to set up routing inside of a next project, we're going to have a very particular set of routes

01:35.430 --> 01:39.690
or files with very particular file names inside this page's directory.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.860
So this page is folder.

01:40.860 --> 01:43.020
Right here is a very magic folder.

01:43.230 --> 01:48.540
Whenever XSS first starts up, it's going to read all the files that we list out inside there and depending

01:48.540 --> 01:52.560
upon the file names and possibly some folders that we create inside there as well.

01:52.560 --> 01:58.470
Next JS is going to interpret those file names as being distinct routes that we can visit inside of

01:58.470 --> 01:59.340
the application.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.620
So let me give you a quick example.

02:01.860 --> 02:05.850
Inside of the pages directory, I'm going to make a new file called Index.

02:07.440 --> 02:13.200
And I'll make another file called How About Banana J's?

02:14.250 --> 02:19.260
So in both of these different files, we're going to create a component and then export it as the default

02:19.260 --> 02:20.040
export.

02:20.700 --> 02:24.450
I'm going to first start off inside of Banana JS at the very top.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.870
I'm going to do an export default.

02:31.220 --> 02:33.380
And I'm going to return an H one.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.670
That says Banana.

02:37.900 --> 02:39.340
And then going to copy this.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.300
I'm going to save this file.

02:42.150 --> 02:43.880
I'm going to go over to indexes.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.150
The file we just created.

02:45.480 --> 02:50.190
I'll paste inside there and I'll change this one to instead say landing page.

02:51.720 --> 02:57.510
So now whenever we start up our project using next next is going to take a look at the contents of pages.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.720
It's going to see there are two files inside of here named indexes.

03:00.750 --> 03:04.860
If we have a file named index that will be used as the root root of our application.

03:04.980 --> 03:10.560
So now any time we try to visit next JJ's or visit this application, we should see the content landing

03:10.560 --> 03:11.550
page on the screen.

03:11.910 --> 03:15.480
If we try to instead navigate to a root of banana.

03:15.480 --> 03:22.020
So in other words, something like local host banana, we should see an h one of banana up here on the

03:22.020 --> 03:22.770
screen instead.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.740
So again, file names map up to root names.

03:26.700 --> 03:27.990
And actually test this thing out.

03:28.020 --> 03:32.120
We need to be able to start up our project to start up a next project.

03:32.130 --> 03:36.990
We're going to go into our package JSON file and we're going to manually write in a couple of scripts

03:36.990 --> 03:37.800
inside of here.

03:38.070 --> 03:41.370
So again, with next JZ, we don't get any generators or anything like that.

03:41.370 --> 03:45.030
We just do all this set up very manually because it's a very small amount of setup.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.860
So I'm going to delete the script section or delete the test script inside there, and I'll replace

03:49.860 --> 03:52.110
it with a dev script.

03:52.470 --> 03:57.420
Whenever we run this dev script, we're going to execute next inside of our project, and that's pretty

03:57.420 --> 03:58.020
much it.

03:59.510 --> 04:02.960
So now to start up our project, we'll go back over to our terminal and run NPM.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.860
Run Dev.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.210
To run next.

04:06.240 --> 04:11.400
Now, just to be really clear, right now, we are executing or starting up next outside of our Kubernetes

04:11.400 --> 04:11.930
cluster.

04:11.940 --> 04:15.090
We are going to be running next inside of Kubernetes.

04:15.360 --> 04:20.130
This is just a very quick demonstration just to get you familiar with this kind of pages, style routing.

04:20.960 --> 04:21.230
Okay.

04:21.230 --> 04:24.740
So back inside of my client directory, I'll do an NPM run, Dev.

04:26.310 --> 04:28.950
That's going to start up our server on localhost 3000.

04:30.390 --> 04:34.920
Now remember, you might already have some stuff running on localhost, 3000 from stuff we did earlier

04:34.920 --> 04:35.970
inside this course.

04:35.970 --> 04:40.200
So if you get some kind of port error or something like that, some kind of start up error, you're

04:40.200 --> 04:44.760
going to need to find whatever process you're still running on Local 3000 and stop it.

04:45.960 --> 04:50.580
So I'm then going to go over to my browser and navigate to Local 3000.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.250
And again, I'm going to see landing page on the screen.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.850
Because any time we come to a route.

04:57.520 --> 05:01.390
By default, index dogs will be loaded inside of the pages directory.

05:01.960 --> 05:06.550
But now if you go to localhost 3000 slash banana, we'll see banana instead.

05:07.090 --> 05:11.860
So really the only thing we got to keep in mind here around next is that these file names and some of

05:11.860 --> 05:16.420
the different folders we create inside of here as well, they're going to map up to actual routes that

05:16.420 --> 05:17.920
we can visit inside the browser.

05:18.670 --> 05:18.890
Okay.

05:18.940 --> 05:23.470
So now that we've got the basics of next put together, quick pause and we'll continue development in

05:23.470 --> 05:24.220
just a moment.
