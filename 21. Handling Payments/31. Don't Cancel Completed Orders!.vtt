There is one other small change we're going to make to our exploration complete listener.

00:04.480 --> 00:09.160
So right now, whenever we receive a message, we're going to find the corresponding order no matter

00:09.160 --> 00:12.520
what, and always mark the order as being cancelled.

00:12.790 --> 00:16.050
And as you can imagine, there might be a kind of big downside to this.

00:16.060 --> 00:21.310
What would happen if we received a cancellation event around an order that has already been paid for?

00:21.640 --> 00:26.410
Well, chances are we would take this order that has already been paid for or be marked as complete

00:26.410 --> 00:28.120
and cancel it anyways.

00:28.390 --> 00:32.230
So we do have to add in a little check here and just make sure that we do not try to cancel an order

00:32.230 --> 00:36.520
that has been paid for right after our little check to make sure that we have an order.

00:37.150 --> 00:42.040
We're going to take a look at the order status property and we're going to say that if this is equal

00:42.040 --> 00:49.750
to order status dot complete, then let's just return early act the message because we do not want to

00:49.750 --> 00:51.850
do anything with this cancellation event.

00:52.180 --> 00:55.980
So I'm going to return early and call message back leg.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.440
So.

00:57.750 --> 00:58.050
Okay.

00:58.080 --> 00:58.990
Good little fix.

00:59.010 --> 01:01.380
Quick pause right here and continue in just a minute.
