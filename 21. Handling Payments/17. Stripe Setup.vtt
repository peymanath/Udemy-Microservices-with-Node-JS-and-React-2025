00:00.990 --> 00:05.040
We've now got some code in place to make sure that we should accept the payment that the user is trying

00:05.040 --> 00:06.020
to provide to us.

00:06.030 --> 00:07.950
So we've done all these validation steps.

00:07.950 --> 00:13.020
So now down here we're going to try to take the token that was provided inside this initial request,

00:13.020 --> 00:16.650
reach out to the Stripe API and actually charge the user's credit card.

00:16.860 --> 00:20.400
Let's first take a look at a diagram just to help you understand exactly what's going to go on with

00:20.400 --> 00:21.000
this step.

00:22.110 --> 00:22.530
All right.

00:22.530 --> 00:23.130
Here we go.

00:23.830 --> 00:25.390
We've got our payment service.

00:25.420 --> 00:30.400
Our ultimate goal is to reach out to the Stripe API and charge the users credit card for some amount.

00:30.550 --> 00:35.470
At this point inside of our payment service, inside that route handler, we just have a token, which

00:35.470 --> 00:41.200
is an authorization to charge the user for some amount of money in order to actually charge the user's

00:41.200 --> 00:41.910
credit card.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.940
We're going to install the Node.js Stripe SDK.

00:45.940 --> 00:50.710
So this is essentially an NPM module that has a little bit of code inside of it to allow us to very

00:50.710 --> 00:52.780
easily communicate with the Stripe API.

00:53.440 --> 00:57.670
We're going to use this module and we're going to call a method inside there to charge the user's credit

00:57.670 --> 00:58.180
card.

00:58.270 --> 01:02.890
When we do so, we're going to provide the token that was included inside the request to our request

01:02.890 --> 01:03.460
handler.

01:03.460 --> 01:09.340
And we're also going to include an API key that is going to identify our application to the Stripe API.

01:10.620 --> 01:13.280
So to move forward, we have to do two different things.

01:13.290 --> 01:17.640
We have to install the Stripe SDK into our payments project.

01:17.850 --> 01:21.750
We also have to sign up for a Stripe account and get an API key.

01:22.020 --> 01:24.720
So we're going to go through both those steps inside this video.

01:25.110 --> 01:29.370
Let's first install the Stripe SDK back at my terminal.

01:29.910 --> 01:34.890
I'm going to change into my payments directory and then do an NPM install stripe.

01:35.430 --> 01:36.480
That's pretty much it.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.530
So I'm going to run this command.

01:38.530 --> 01:41.140
Very small module should install rather quickly.

01:42.020 --> 01:42.190
Okay.

01:42.350 --> 01:43.370
That was easy enough.

01:43.910 --> 01:49.400
Next up, we're going to go to the stripe website, sign up for an account and get an API key.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.520
So to do so inside of a new browser tab, I'm going to navigate to Stripe.

01:57.630 --> 02:04.080
Now just, you know, the strip landing page and the documentation changes its look and theme rather

02:04.080 --> 02:04.860
frequently.

02:04.860 --> 02:09.180
So if you come to this page and it looks different than what I see, that is totally okay.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.590
The Stripe API itself rarely changes.

02:12.600 --> 02:17.550
It's actually pretty famous for being a rather stable API, so even if some stuff on this page looks

02:17.550 --> 02:21.960
a little bit different, it's probably going to be totally just fine because the API itself is pretty

02:21.960 --> 02:22.980
darn stable.

02:23.890 --> 02:26.380
So once a year, we're going to try to create a new account.

02:26.620 --> 02:30.700
You can either click on sign in on the top right, or just click the green start now button.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.280
Well, then sign up for a new account.

02:35.190 --> 02:37.200
So I'm going to create a new account myself as well.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.470
And it does not like my password.

02:45.860 --> 02:46.370
There we go.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.090
Good enough.

02:53.750 --> 02:54.260
All right.

02:54.260 --> 02:55.040
There we go.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.560
Really demanding on that password.

03:00.260 --> 03:05.180
So once we sign in for the very first time, we'll come to a landing screen that looks like this.

03:05.420 --> 03:09.080
The only thing we really want to do right now is try to find our API key.

03:09.820 --> 03:14.200
The other thing we're going to have to do just, you know, we have to verify our email address.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.090
So you will want to open up your email.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.100
You will get an email from Stripe.

03:18.100 --> 03:21.160
It's probably going to look a little something like this right here.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.990
So it says, just click this link.

03:22.990 --> 03:24.730
Just make sure you do exactly what it says.

03:24.730 --> 03:26.890
Just click on Verify Email address.

03:27.980 --> 03:33.680
So once we have verified our account, we're then going to either click on Get Test API keys right here.

03:33.710 --> 03:39.530
If you do not see that link on the main page, you can also find developers on the left tab, click

03:39.530 --> 03:42.020
on developers and then click on API keys.

03:42.530 --> 03:47.270
Either way, you will come to a page that looks like this and you're going to see a publishable key

03:47.270 --> 03:48.800
and a secret key.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.980
So we're going to leave this page open for just a moment.

03:52.010 --> 03:53.450
We're going to take a pause right now.

03:53.450 --> 03:58.580
And when we come back, the next video, we're going to set up the Stripe SDK inside of our project.
