00:00.990 --> 00:06.660
We just signed up for the Strike API and now on this API Keys page, we can see both a publishable key

00:06.660 --> 00:08.160
and a secret key.

00:08.340 --> 00:11.700
The secret key is the one that we want to make use of inside of our project.

00:11.730 --> 00:15.990
This is what it's going to allow us to reach out to the Stripe API and somehow charge a user's credit

00:15.990 --> 00:16.470
card.

00:16.860 --> 00:20.210
So we want to somehow use this key right here inside of our project.

00:20.220 --> 00:25.380
But as you'd guess from the name of Secret Key, we really do not want to put this secret right here

00:25.380 --> 00:27.450
in plaintext inside of our project.

00:27.900 --> 00:32.010
Now, this is something we have dealt with in the past, and you might recall that in order to store

00:32.010 --> 00:37.740
some secret information or some private keys inside of a Kubernetes cluster, we can create an object

00:37.740 --> 00:39.000
called a secret.

00:39.030 --> 00:44.160
Secrets are used to store secret information, just like an API key that we have right here.

00:44.490 --> 00:47.010
We have created a secret once before inside this course.

00:47.010 --> 00:51.120
So let's go back over to our terminal and create another secret that will store this.

00:51.900 --> 00:52.770
Stripe key.

00:54.120 --> 00:54.380
Okay.

00:54.390 --> 00:59.910
So back at my terminal to create a secret, we will write out CTL create secret.

01:01.330 --> 01:02.230
Generic.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.690
Well, then put in the name of the secret.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.450
So we're going to call it Stripe secret.

01:08.860 --> 01:14.920
Then Dash dash from literal and then we'll put in a collection of key value pairs at the end of the

01:14.920 --> 01:15.580
command.

01:16.450 --> 01:23.020
So we will write out Stripe, underscore key and then the value that we want to assign to this property.

01:23.350 --> 01:27.820
In this case, our key is the secret key we just saw inside of our browser.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.010
So I'm going to take that secret key right there.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.330
I'm going to copy it.

01:32.230 --> 01:34.570
And then paste it at the very end.

01:36.010 --> 01:36.400
All done.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.210
Run this.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.450
And we can see that our secret has been created.

01:40.780 --> 01:43.930
I should now be able to do a little get secrets.

01:45.090 --> 01:48.870
And I will see that I have a new secret called Stripe secret.

01:49.980 --> 01:55.080
So now if you want to make use of this inside of our payment service, we have to open up the the deployment

01:55.080 --> 01:55.620
file.

01:56.430 --> 01:57.240
And tell Kubernetes.

01:57.240 --> 02:01.860
So you want to take the information stored inside the secret and assign it to the pod created by our

02:01.860 --> 02:03.090
payments deployment.

02:03.420 --> 02:04.590
So let's do that right now.

02:05.630 --> 02:08.540
Back inside my editor, I will find the infrared directory.

02:09.320 --> 02:16.070
Inside the folder, I'm going to find our payments deployment and then I'll scroll down a little bit

02:16.070 --> 02:17.630
to the environment section.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.750
So you'll notice inside of here we've already got that JSON web token.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.540
Being assigned from a secret as well.

02:24.550 --> 02:26.920
So we're going to be essentially right out the same kind of block.

02:26.920 --> 02:31.540
But we'll reference the s the stripe secret that we just created a moment ago.

02:32.140 --> 02:34.060
So I'm going to put in a name.

02:34.930 --> 02:37.390
Is Stripe underscore key.

02:39.050 --> 02:40.310
Then value from.

02:41.060 --> 02:42.710
Secret key ref.

02:44.210 --> 02:48.800
The name of the secret that we want to pull this value from is Stripe.

02:48.980 --> 02:50.360
Dash secret.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.950
And the name of the key is Stripe Key.

02:55.220 --> 03:00.410
So this is going to give us an environment variable available inside of our project called Stripe Underscore

03:00.410 --> 03:00.950
Key.

03:01.910 --> 03:06.140
And that's going to make sure that we do not have to write out that entire secret key in plain text,

03:06.140 --> 03:08.720
which is definitely a fantastic improvement.

03:09.800 --> 03:10.070
All right.

03:10.070 --> 03:12.930
So now that we've created that secret, we're going to take another pause right here.

03:12.950 --> 03:18.590
We'll then make use of that environment variable and initialize the Stripe SDK inside of our new handler

03:18.590 --> 03:19.550
in the next video.
