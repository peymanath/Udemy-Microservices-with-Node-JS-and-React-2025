00:00.910 --> 00:04.990
Our sign in wrote Handler is now looking pretty good, so let's do a very quick test of it.

00:05.080 --> 00:07.300
I'm going to flip back over to Postman.

00:08.930 --> 00:11.980
I'm going to change my route right here to sign up.

00:11.990 --> 00:16.460
So from this point on, we do need to make sure that we have some email and password combinations that

00:16.460 --> 00:21.110
we can actually remember because we need to sign up and then sign in with the same email and password.

00:21.500 --> 00:27.440
So I'm going to put in an email, my personal favorite, which is test, test and a password of simply

00:27.440 --> 00:28.070
password.

00:30.100 --> 00:31.720
Well, then go ahead and send that.

00:33.160 --> 00:33.460
And.

00:33.460 --> 00:34.960
All right, I have my account.

00:36.140 --> 00:39.320
I'll now change my route up here to sign in.

00:40.310 --> 00:44.720
And I'm going to send in a request with the same exact email and password.

00:46.220 --> 00:46.550
Awesome.

00:46.550 --> 00:52.100
So I got back the user that I am now signed in as and in theory we should have also gotten back a brand

00:52.100 --> 00:54.350
new cookie right here when we signed in.

00:56.550 --> 01:00.120
We can also test on the invalid cases as well, even though we really already did that.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.580
So for example, I could put in an empty password.

01:03.000 --> 01:03.270
Nope.

01:03.270 --> 01:03.920
Doesn't work.

01:03.930 --> 01:08.430
I could put in a valid password, but one that does not match my existing one.

01:09.210 --> 01:11.350
So if I send that in, I get invalid credentials.

01:11.370 --> 01:12.180
That looks good.

01:12.810 --> 01:16.440
I can also try to enter in an email that doesn't actually exist.

01:16.440 --> 01:22.170
So email of test one at test and I get the same invalid credentials.

01:23.860 --> 01:24.050
Okay.

01:24.130 --> 01:25.450
So I'd say that looks pretty good.

01:25.870 --> 01:29.500
Well, we've got sign in all complete and sign up all complete.

01:29.830 --> 01:32.170
Still have a little bit to do around authentication.

01:32.170 --> 01:35.800
Now, as a reminder, as we're going through this stuff, we're going to be putting it all together

01:35.800 --> 01:37.560
more quickly and more quickly.

01:37.570 --> 01:42.340
So we're going to go through the create or semi, the current user, a route handler to figure out whether

01:42.340 --> 01:43.540
or not someone has signed in.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.050
And we're also going to put together a log out handler as well.

01:47.050 --> 01:50.470
And both those are going to be put together pretty darn quickly.

01:50.620 --> 01:53.350
So quick pause right here and we'll continue in just a minute.
