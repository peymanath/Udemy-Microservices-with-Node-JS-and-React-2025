00:01.280 --> 00:05.600
We've now taken a look at fundamental option, number one, and number two for handling the question

00:05.600 --> 00:08.980
of whether or not a user is authenticated inside of our application.

00:08.990 --> 00:13.910
So just to summarize these two things with fundamental option number one, we said that every individual

00:13.910 --> 00:19.460
service was going to rely upon some central OTT service, either as some outside service or as a central

00:19.460 --> 00:20.120
gateway.

00:20.780 --> 00:26.450
The benefit to this approach reflected here in green is that any time that we made changes to our authentication

00:26.450 --> 00:31.970
state or the access of a user, it would be immediately reflected throughout the rest of our cluster

00:31.970 --> 00:33.560
or throughout the rest of our services.

00:33.890 --> 00:38.900
So if we set a user was banned as soon as the next service came and asked about the status of a user

00:38.900 --> 00:43.280
or whether or not they were actually signed in, we could absolutely say this person is banned, do

00:43.280 --> 00:44.450
not allow them access.

00:45.050 --> 00:49.730
The really big downside to this approach was that if the service ever went down, our entire app would

00:49.730 --> 00:50.510
be broken.

00:51.620 --> 00:56.720
Now fundamental number two really is the exact opposite in nature with the fundamental option.

00:56.720 --> 01:00.280
Number two, we were going to teach each service how to authenticate a user.

01:00.290 --> 01:03.860
So in this case, if the service ever went down, who cares?

01:03.860 --> 01:04.940
Doesn't matter.

01:05.210 --> 01:10.580
Our other services don't even have to understand that the authentication service exists.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.770
That was the big upside to this approach.

01:13.220 --> 01:18.230
However, the downside was that if some user ever got banned, there is going to be a window or a period

01:18.230 --> 01:22.640
of time where we were going to continue to trust that that user was actually signed in.

01:22.640 --> 01:26.870
So we can imagine that someone might come to us and say, Hey, that person was just banned, and we

01:26.870 --> 01:32.120
would respond, Oh, man, I just gave them keys to my bank account or something like that 5 minutes

01:32.120 --> 01:36.020
ago because we are being told too late that this user is now banned.

01:37.420 --> 01:42.490
So the real question here, as it really comes to us, as it applies to us, which option are we going

01:42.490 --> 01:43.210
to go with?

01:43.240 --> 01:46.060
Well, the answer is we are going to go with option number two.

01:46.880 --> 01:51.890
So we're going to go with option number two specifically because I want to promote this idea of making

01:51.890 --> 01:53.570
independent services.

01:53.660 --> 01:57.300
Remember, in all things micro services, there really is a spectrum.

01:57.320 --> 02:02.150
Throughout this course, we've been following this idea of async communication, which really leads

02:02.150 --> 02:05.360
to a huge amount of independence between our different services.

02:05.570 --> 02:07.850
But we absolutely can have a hybrid of sorts.

02:07.850 --> 02:14.150
We can have a setup where we've got a ton of async communication going on, but we can also have some

02:14.180 --> 02:16.940
little instances of sync communication as well.

02:17.270 --> 02:21.980
So regardless of that, I do want to promote this idea of independent services.

02:21.980 --> 02:23.960
So we're going to go with option number two.

02:25.220 --> 02:27.520
Now, you still might say, Stephen, wait a minute.

02:27.530 --> 02:30.200
There's like a fundamental security issue here.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.520
How would we solve that?

02:31.550 --> 02:32.600
Well, don't sweat it.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.290
I got your back.

02:33.290 --> 02:34.420
I got an answer for you.

02:34.430 --> 02:39.650
There is a way that we can solve this entire problem of banning users or updating their authentication

02:39.650 --> 02:40.610
state in some way.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.700
However, it is kind of a little bit longer explanation.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.290
So we're going to take a pause right here.

02:45.290 --> 02:49.130
And in the next video I'm going to give you an optional lecture so you do not have to listen to it if

02:49.130 --> 02:50.030
you do not want to.

02:50.030 --> 02:54.710
But I'm going to tell you about one strategy we could use to get over this really big issue with option

02:54.710 --> 02:55.400
number two.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.190
So quick pause and we'll take a look at that in just a moment.
