00:01.290 --> 00:06.210
As we discussed in the last video, we need to somehow make the JSON web token sign key available to

00:06.210 --> 00:07.500
all of our different services.

00:07.710 --> 00:13.290
We're going to solve this using a feature inside of Kubernetes that is designed for sharing secret information

00:13.290 --> 00:15.450
throughout different pieces of our application.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.130
So a couple of quick diagrams.

00:17.670 --> 00:19.830
This is a diagram of our Kubernetes node.

00:19.860 --> 00:22.380
Inside of it, there are many different pods in it.

00:22.380 --> 00:27.420
And in our case, all these different pods are running a container that needs to somehow get access

00:27.420 --> 00:29.520
to that JSON web token signing key.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.200
To do so, we are going to create a new kind of object inside of our cluster.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.260
So this is an object called a secret.

00:37.890 --> 00:42.470
Remember that objects are referring to just about everything that we create inside of Kubernetes.

00:42.480 --> 00:46.020
So a pod is an object, a deployment is an object, and so on.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.330
A secret is a is a object.

00:48.330 --> 00:53.700
Just the same inside of a secret, we can store little key value pairs of information.

00:53.940 --> 00:59.190
So you and I can create a secret that's going to store something that says JSON web token key equals

00:59.220 --> 01:01.800
SDF or something very similar to that.

01:02.400 --> 01:07.050
Once we create the secret, we can load it into the containers that are created inside of all of our

01:07.050 --> 01:08.010
different pods.

01:09.520 --> 01:12.760
The secret is going to be exposed as an environment variable.

01:13.440 --> 01:18.060
Now this diagram right here is just a little bit deceptive because I'm saying that inside of our pod,

01:18.060 --> 01:23.060
we've got some off thing and there's some environment variables, to be precise.

01:23.070 --> 01:29.160
We have our application right here, really the node program of off that is running inside of a container.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.820
And inside of that container there are a set of environment variables.

01:33.030 --> 01:36.900
So when I'm saying that there is an environment variable inside the pod, the environment variable is

01:36.900 --> 01:40.680
really inside the same container as the application.

01:41.640 --> 01:47.940
So we're going to take that JSON key or that JSON web token key equals SDF, assign it to these environment

01:47.940 --> 01:53.310
variable sets, and then we can easily access that information from inside of our Node.js code.

01:53.820 --> 01:59.610
So that's how we're going to store the JSON web token signing key in one location securely and then

01:59.610 --> 02:03.210
actually get it available to all the different services that need it.

02:04.070 --> 02:06.890
So now that we understand what we're going to do, another quick pause right here.

02:06.890 --> 02:11.690
We will create the secret in the next video and then make sure that it gets exposed to all of our different

02:11.690 --> 02:12.800
microservices.
