In this video, we're going to take a look at some alternate forms of syntax around annotations for

00:05.700 --> 00:06.450
functions.

00:06.780 --> 00:12.240
So underneath my two functions I already have, I'm going to define another one called Divide, and

00:12.240 --> 00:14.850
you'll notice I'm going to use the keyword function right here.

00:15.120 --> 00:19.740
So how do we use these annotations with a function defined with the function keyword?

00:19.770 --> 00:21.570
Well, basically the exact same way.

00:21.930 --> 00:23.640
So we'll have two arguments.

00:24.450 --> 00:28.080
A and B, and we need to annotate both them.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.340
So we'll say A is going to be A number and B is going to be a number as well.

00:32.970 --> 00:38.070
Then to annotate the return type of this, again, right after the argument list, we'll put in a colon

00:38.340 --> 00:40.620
and then the type of value we expect to return.

00:41.310 --> 00:43.080
Then we can return.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.880
A divided baby like so.

00:47.540 --> 00:51.980
Now this syntax is going to also work for anonymous functions assigned to variables too.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.380
So I could say const multiply.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.280
Will be a function.

00:58.590 --> 01:03.420
This will take two arguments of A and B, once again, both numbers.

01:05.240 --> 01:09.680
And again, right after that argument list, we can annotate the return type as well.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.900
And so then inside the function A times B like so.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.210
And that's pretty much it.

01:15.040 --> 01:21.730
So any time that we need to define a function using an arrow, a named function, or an anonymous function

01:21.730 --> 01:26.050
assigned to a variable, we're always going to see a near identical form of syntax.

01:26.050 --> 01:30.130
It's always going to be the arguments with the colon and then the expected type.

01:30.370 --> 01:35.830
And then immediately after the closing parentheses, we will do another colon and the expected type

01:35.860 --> 01:37.450
of the return value from the function.

01:37.450 --> 01:38.530
And that's pretty much it.

01:39.270 --> 01:42.430
Get a quick pause here and we'll talk about one less thing in the next video.
