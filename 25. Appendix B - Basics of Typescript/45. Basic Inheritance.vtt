00:00.610 --> 00:01.180
In this video.

00:01.180 --> 00:06.100
We're going to continue discussing classes in TypeScript by taking a look at the inheritance system.

00:06.670 --> 00:11.230
So right underneath my class vehicle, I'm going to get started by creating a second class definition.

00:11.650 --> 00:13.720
I'm going to call this thing car like so.

00:14.490 --> 00:19.260
I want you to think about the relationship between a car and a vehicle in the real world.

00:19.290 --> 00:24.900
I think that we would say that a car is a type of vehicle and chances are that a whatever a car can

00:24.900 --> 00:25.320
do.

00:25.350 --> 00:27.180
A vehicle should be able to do as well.

00:27.330 --> 00:31.950
So, for example, a car should be able to drive and it should probably be able to honk as well.

00:32.550 --> 00:39.030
So we would probably want our class car to have essentially all the same methods or functions of class

00:39.030 --> 00:41.240
vehicle to make that happen.

00:41.250 --> 00:46.920
We could either copy paste all these methods down here like so, or alternatively we could have our

00:46.920 --> 00:49.830
class car extend the vehicle class.

00:50.460 --> 00:51.060
To do so.

00:51.060 --> 00:56.940
I'm going to find class car right here and then right after I'm going to say extends vehicle like so.

00:57.570 --> 01:01.860
By writing in this little additional syntax right here, we're essentially telling TypeScript that we

01:01.860 --> 01:07.290
want it to take all the different methods inside of this class and essentially copy paste them over

01:07.290 --> 01:08.490
to class car.

01:09.090 --> 01:11.890
Now, there's not actually a real copy paste going on here.

01:11.910 --> 01:16.710
The actual system is a little bit more complicated, and we're going to go deeper into that system over

01:16.710 --> 01:17.280
time.

01:17.280 --> 01:22.350
But if right now we can just imagine that by adding on extends vehicle, we're essentially taking all

01:22.350 --> 01:25.080
these methods and copy pasting them down like so.

01:26.750 --> 01:27.590
So now.

01:28.550 --> 01:33.100
Where we create a new vehicle down here, rather than creating a vehicle, we can delete all that.

01:33.110 --> 01:36.290
And instead let's try creating an instance of a car.

01:36.620 --> 01:39.590
So I'm going to say car is new car like so.

01:40.010 --> 01:44.750
And then on this instance of the class, we can now call all the different methods that we had associated

01:44.750 --> 01:45.800
with vehicle.

01:46.070 --> 01:50.240
So we can say car drive and car honk like so.

01:51.270 --> 01:56.250
Now, if I save this file, flip back over to my terminal and run the file again, we're going to see

01:56.250 --> 01:57.900
the same output once again.

01:58.840 --> 02:04.360
When we have a class that extends another, we can optionally choose to override different methods.

02:04.630 --> 02:09.400
So, for example, let's say that we want our car class right here to have a different implementation

02:09.400 --> 02:11.380
of drive than the parent class.

02:12.190 --> 02:16.360
To do so we can simply redefine drive inside of car.

02:17.620 --> 02:22.390
I'm going to again annotate this with the return type of void and maybe inside there for our car rather

02:22.390 --> 02:24.250
than doing a console log of chugga chugga.

02:24.280 --> 02:28.060
I instead wanted to do a console log of like vroom.

02:28.060 --> 02:28.870
Like so.

02:30.080 --> 02:34.550
So if we now save this again and flip back over to our terminal, we can rerun the file once more.

02:34.550 --> 02:36.220
And no longer are we going to do that.

02:36.230 --> 02:38.510
Chugga, chugga and we'll see vroom instead.

02:39.050 --> 02:43.790
So we've successfully overridden a method on the child class.

02:43.880 --> 02:49.280
We refer to CAR as a child class because it is extending vehicle.

02:49.580 --> 02:53.570
We would refer to vehicle in this case as this superclass or the parent class.

02:55.240 --> 02:55.540
All right.

02:55.540 --> 02:59.240
Now that we've taken a look at basic inheritance, let's take another quick pause right here.

02:59.260 --> 03:02.260
We're going to address a couple more side topics around classes.
