00:00.740 --> 00:02.940
We've now gotten a definition of types.

00:02.960 --> 00:04.610
We've spoken about why we care about them.

00:04.610 --> 00:06.670
And we just looked at a couple of quick examples.

00:06.680 --> 00:09.470
It's now the last thing we're going to cover is when to use them.

00:10.100 --> 00:10.400
All right.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.420
So this one's kind of an easy one in this case and some of the other topics we're going to look at,

00:14.420 --> 00:17.570
well, there's going to be a lot better answer of where we use them.

00:17.570 --> 00:20.150
But in the case of types, well, we use them everywhere.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.610
And that's just a side effect of using TypeScript.

00:22.610 --> 00:28.070
So whether you want to or not, every value you define inside your application is going to have a type

00:28.070 --> 00:33.050
associated with it, and TypeScript is going to do its best to check the quality of your code or check

00:33.050 --> 00:35.360
for any errors by using those types.

00:35.690 --> 00:40.700
So like I said, for this particular feature, well, types are used everywhere and there's really not

00:40.700 --> 00:42.110
that much else to say about it.

00:42.800 --> 00:43.040
All right.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.270
So let's take a quick pause right here.

00:44.270 --> 00:45.380
This is kind of a gimme.

00:45.380 --> 00:46.580
Let's take a pause right here.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.070
And we're going to move on to our next feature in the next video.
