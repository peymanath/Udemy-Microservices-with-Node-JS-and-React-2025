In this video, we're going to start to discuss interfaces in TypeScript.

00:03.830 --> 00:07.880
So as usual, we'll get a plain definition, some examples and so on.

00:08.270 --> 00:12.200
As a quick aside here, we're going to spend a pretty good amount of time in TypeScript talking about

00:12.200 --> 00:13.160
interfaces.

00:13.550 --> 00:19.370
The interplay between interfaces and classes is how we're going to really get very strong code reuse

00:19.370 --> 00:21.110
when we are writing TypeScript code.

00:21.410 --> 00:27.020
So if you understand interfaces really well, it's going to help you design really excellent applications.

00:27.500 --> 00:31.850
As a matter of fact, the entire second half of this course where we're going to work on a lot of applications

00:31.850 --> 00:36.890
is really going to come down to understanding how we can get interfaces and classes to work together

00:36.890 --> 00:38.630
really, really nicely.

00:39.390 --> 00:43.530
So if you don't understand this first take through interfaces, totally fine, because we're going to

00:43.530 --> 00:45.300
be discussing them quite a bit.

00:45.720 --> 00:46.080
All right.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.600
So with that in mind, let's take a look at a quick definition here.

00:49.110 --> 00:54.540
So when we have interfaces, we are going to write out some amount of code to define a new type inside

00:54.540 --> 00:55.500
of our application.

00:55.950 --> 01:01.560
The goal of this new type is to describe the different property names and the different property types

01:01.680 --> 01:03.330
that that object has.

01:04.150 --> 01:08.440
So when we create an interface, we are creating a new type inside of our application, just the same

01:08.440 --> 01:12.260
way that we have types like string or Boolean or number.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.350
We're creating another new type.

01:14.350 --> 01:17.440
It's a custom type that you and I are going to define.

01:18.580 --> 01:21.890
Understanding interfaces is a lot easier when you have some code in front of you.

01:21.910 --> 01:23.230
So let's do a quick pause right here.

01:23.260 --> 01:25.900
Come back in the next video and start to write out some examples.
