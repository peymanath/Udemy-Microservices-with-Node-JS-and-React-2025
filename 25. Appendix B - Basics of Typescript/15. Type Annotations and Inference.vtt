00:00.970 --> 00:01.600
In this video.

00:01.600 --> 00:05.530
We're going to move on to our next big subject, which is type annotations and type inference.

00:05.860 --> 00:10.000
These are technically two different systems inside of TypeScript, but we're going to talk about them

00:10.000 --> 00:11.740
in parallel for a very good reason.

00:12.250 --> 00:16.630
Just to make things a little bit more complicated as well, these two different features apply slightly

00:16.630 --> 00:20.170
differently to variable declarations, functions and objects.

00:20.590 --> 00:24.550
So we're going to first talk about type annotations and inference as applied to variables.

00:24.880 --> 00:29.140
Then we'll take a break and talk about them, applied to functions and then objects and so on.

00:30.160 --> 00:34.150
For each of these different subjects, we're going to once again go through some plain definition and

00:34.150 --> 00:34.900
overview.

00:35.140 --> 00:38.460
Well, then take a look at some different code examples that we're going to write out together.

00:38.470 --> 00:41.080
You'll notice I swap these two steps right here at this time around.

00:41.080 --> 00:45.310
So we'll then talk about why we care about this annotation and inference stuff, and then we'll discuss

00:45.310 --> 00:46.180
when to use it.

00:46.570 --> 00:47.740
So let's get to it.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.340
First off, some plain definitions.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.810
So type annotations.

00:51.810 --> 00:52.590
What is that?

00:52.860 --> 00:58.710
A type annotation is some tiny bit of code that you and I are going to write to tell TypeScript what

00:58.740 --> 01:01.260
type of value a variable refers to.

01:02.600 --> 01:02.900
All right.

01:02.900 --> 01:06.020
Now, before expanding on that definition, let's talk about what type inference is.

01:06.020 --> 01:11.690
So with type inference, TypeScript is going to attempt to automatically figure out what type of value

01:11.690 --> 01:12.920
a variable refers to.

01:13.580 --> 01:16.790
And you'll notice that the kind of definition of both of these are very similar.

01:16.790 --> 01:22.370
In both cases, it's what type of valuable, what type of value a variable will refer to.

01:22.760 --> 01:27.500
So the interesting thing about type annotations and type inference is that they're kind of at odds with

01:27.500 --> 01:28.130
each other.

01:28.310 --> 01:34.220
In one case, you and I are adding in a little bit of code to tell TypeScript what different types we

01:34.220 --> 01:36.530
are working with, with type inference.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.620
We are relying upon TypeScript to do that work for us.

01:40.010 --> 01:45.170
So these two features are a question of Are you and I are going to do everything manually or are we

01:45.200 --> 01:47.030
going to leave it up to TypeScript?

01:47.060 --> 01:49.100
That's what the big question here is.

01:49.100 --> 01:53.210
And that's what what is going to be the big focus of our discussion about, you know, why we care about

01:53.210 --> 01:54.950
these features and when to use them.

01:55.580 --> 01:56.930
Now, let's take a quick pause right here.

01:56.930 --> 02:00.680
We're going to come back to the next video and start taking a look at a couple of different code samples.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.750
So a quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
