00:00.520 --> 00:03.970
In this video, I want to start to add in one last feature to our application.

00:04.180 --> 00:06.210
I'm at the Google Maps documentation right here.

00:06.220 --> 00:08.290
Don't worry about pulling this up on your own screen.

00:08.290 --> 00:10.090
I just want to show you something really quickly.

00:10.480 --> 00:13.370
Notice how there's a marker right here, just like the marker we have placed.

00:13.390 --> 00:18.610
If I click on that marker, I get a little pop up right here that has some information that's relevant

00:18.610 --> 00:19.510
to that marker.

00:19.840 --> 00:22.360
So that's exactly what I want to make inside of our application.

00:22.360 --> 00:26.980
I want to make sure that any time that we click on one of our markers, we show some information relevant

00:26.980 --> 00:30.460
to the company or the user that this marker represents.

00:30.940 --> 00:34.480
So let's figure out first how to just open up a window like this.

00:35.080 --> 00:39.760
To do so, we could either read our type definition file again, or in this case we could just read

00:39.760 --> 00:41.140
the official documentation.

00:41.140 --> 00:45.310
In this case, we're going to take a look at the official documentation because showing this info window

00:45.310 --> 00:49.150
is a little bit more complicated than adding the marker or showing the map.

00:49.780 --> 00:52.060
So really quickly, let's take a look at the documentation.

00:52.810 --> 00:55.750
So there's a code snippet right here for the map we were just looking at.

00:56.200 --> 01:01.750
So the first thing they do is create a string that contains some amount of HTML that will be shown inside

01:01.750 --> 01:03.010
of that pop up window.

01:03.740 --> 01:07.760
Then immediately after that, they create an instance of something called an info window.

01:07.940 --> 01:10.040
The info window is the pop up.

01:10.040 --> 01:15.380
So this is going to be an instance of a class or an object that represents the pop up window.

01:15.950 --> 01:22.070
When they create the info window, they pass in the content that the window will display as an option.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.080
They then go on to create a marker.

01:25.230 --> 01:28.950
And then finally they add an event listener to the marker itself.

01:29.160 --> 01:33.030
So any time the marker gets clicked, they find the info window.

01:33.060 --> 01:39.300
They call the open method on it, and they pass in the map that they want to show the window on and

01:39.300 --> 01:41.760
the marker that they want to show the window above.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.440
And that's pretty much it.

01:44.460 --> 01:48.660
So we could look at our type definition file again to understand how to do all this stuff.

01:48.660 --> 01:52.830
But like I said, in this case, creating an info window is a little bit more complicated.

01:52.830 --> 01:55.800
So I just want to take a look at the official documentation really quickly.

01:56.070 --> 02:00.690
Now, having said that, let's take a look at the type definition of file anyways and just try to find

02:00.690 --> 02:06.330
where the info window is defined inside the type definition and where we can find like all the possible

02:06.330 --> 02:09.360
options we can pass in to customize the info window as well.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.620
So back inside my editor, I'm at custom map.

02:13.650 --> 02:19.050
I'm going to do another command click on Google Maps map that's going to pull open the type definition

02:19.050 --> 02:20.550
of file for Google Maps.

02:20.550 --> 02:27.570
And inside of here, I'm going to do a search for info window and we're looking for class info window.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.590
There it is right there.

02:29.640 --> 02:34.770
So to get a good idea of how to use this info window, we could either read that official documentation

02:34.770 --> 02:37.010
or read the type definition file.

02:37.020 --> 02:40.410
You'll notice that there's actually comments inside of here to help you understand how to use it.

02:41.050 --> 02:42.300
So here's the constructor.

02:42.310 --> 02:45.850
Remember, this thing gets called any time we create an instance of a class.

02:46.180 --> 02:51.700
So in other words, any time we have like this right here, new info window, that is us calling the

02:51.700 --> 02:52.510
constructor.

02:53.020 --> 02:57.610
So this object right here that gets passed in is going to be an argument to the constructor.

02:58.180 --> 03:04.150
So that means that options object is going to be this argument right here, and that object has to satisfy

03:04.150 --> 03:05.020
this type.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.450
So we can look at the definition of this type and understand what different options we can pass into

03:10.450 --> 03:11.350
the info window.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.310
So I'm going to again command click on info window options right here.

03:15.910 --> 03:20.050
And like I said, this will tell us about all the different properties we can pass into the info window

03:20.050 --> 03:21.280
when we create it.

03:22.340 --> 03:25.230
So you'll notice one of the first options right here is content.

03:25.250 --> 03:31.670
So like we just saw, content is going to be the HTML or the plain string that will be displayed inside

03:31.670 --> 03:32.750
the info window.

03:33.860 --> 03:37.640
So we could also take a look at some of the other properties we can pass in to the info window when

03:37.640 --> 03:38.450
we create it.

03:38.480 --> 03:42.980
None of these other ones are super relevant for us, but just wanted to to remind you that we can take

03:42.980 --> 03:48.170
a look at the different options by referencing the type index file as opposed to trying to find the

03:48.170 --> 03:50.570
different options inside the official documentation.

03:51.780 --> 03:52.290
All right.

03:52.290 --> 03:54.410
So I think that's enough of the type definition file.

03:54.420 --> 03:58.680
Again, I just wanted to remind you that we can figure out how to use an info window by looking at this

03:58.680 --> 03:59.580
stuff instead.

04:01.180 --> 04:01.450
All right.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.740
So I'm going to go back over to my custom map class now to get started.

04:04.750 --> 04:09.370
We're just going to try to show a plain info window with some generic content inside of it.

04:09.400 --> 04:13.490
I'm not going to worry about showing some information about a specific user or company.

04:13.510 --> 04:15.040
Let's just get like some.

04:15.040 --> 04:15.730
Hi there.

04:15.730 --> 04:18.430
Or like hello world text inside of an info window.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.640
So to do so, I'm going to go down to my add marker method.

04:22.400 --> 04:29.660
So any time we create a marker, I'm going to assign that marker to a temporary variable like so.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.990
Then I'm going to add an event listener to the marker.

04:33.990 --> 04:38.820
So anytime we click on this marker, we're going to run a function, and inside that function is where

04:38.820 --> 04:40.530
we are going to create our info window.

04:40.860 --> 04:44.700
So I'll say marker dot, add listener.

04:45.730 --> 04:49.150
Any time that thing gets clicked, let's run this function right here.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.180
So then inside of here we can create our info window.

04:52.450 --> 04:59.710
So I'll say const info window is new google maps dot info window.

05:00.790 --> 05:03.210
We're going to pass in the options object.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.820
Remember that options object can have a content property.

05:07.210 --> 05:11.260
So I'm going to say that anytime we show this info window just shows some content inside of it that

05:11.260 --> 05:12.940
says hi there like so.

05:14.410 --> 05:20.710
And then finally we'll do an info window open and I'm going to pass in a reference to the map that I

05:20.710 --> 05:25.960
want to show this window on and a reference to the marker that we're going to show this above.

05:27.380 --> 05:32.150
So the map we're going to show this on is going to be this dot Google map, because remember, we stored

05:32.150 --> 05:36.230
a reference to our Google map as a property of our custom map class.

05:38.190 --> 05:42.900
And then the second argument will be the marker that we want to show this above, which is the marker

05:42.900 --> 05:44.610
we just created 2 seconds ago.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.850
Now, one thing I want to mention really quickly, I know back over here in the code snippet, they

05:48.850 --> 05:55.390
first create the info window and then later on once the marker gets clicked, they only call info window

05:55.600 --> 05:56.140
open.

05:56.350 --> 05:58.060
So we're doing things just a little bit differently.

05:58.060 --> 06:02.200
We are saying we're not going to create the info window until the marker gets clicked.

06:02.410 --> 06:03.740
Honestly, there's no difference.

06:03.760 --> 06:08.940
You could just as easily move the creation of the info window outside of the event handler.

06:08.950 --> 06:09.760
It's totally up to you.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.110
No difference whatsoever.

06:11.870 --> 06:15.650
But I'm just going to put it inside because I think the code makes just a little bit more sense this

06:15.650 --> 06:16.070
way.

06:18.140 --> 06:21.500
All right, so let's save this and we'll do a quick test back inside of our browser.

06:21.830 --> 06:23.900
So back inside my browser, here we go.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.220
I'll do a quick refresh.

06:25.340 --> 06:29.390
And now if I click on a marker, I should see a pop up appear that says Hi there.

06:29.630 --> 06:30.320
Perfect.

06:31.180 --> 06:31.420
All right.

06:31.420 --> 06:32.560
So this looks pretty good.

06:32.590 --> 06:38.230
Obviously, the only downside here is that we don't have any customization of these pop ups for a company

06:38.230 --> 06:39.210
or a user.

06:39.220 --> 06:42.430
So I don't even know if this marker represents a user or a company.

06:42.850 --> 06:46.720
So let's take another quick pause right here and we'll figure out how to fix that up in the next video.
