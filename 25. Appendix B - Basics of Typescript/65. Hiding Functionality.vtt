00:01.370 --> 00:03.950
We can now show a Google map on the screen, which is great.

00:03.950 --> 00:08.660
But before we move on and start showing any markers, there's one last little thing I want to mention.

00:08.840 --> 00:11.570
So I want to focus on the index file right now.

00:11.780 --> 00:13.420
I want to point out something inside of here.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.020
This is going to seem like a really strange thing to point out.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.810
Nonetheless, I just want to mention it.

00:18.530 --> 00:22.520
Let's just take a look at a diagram and I think you'll start to understand what I'm going to be talking

00:22.520 --> 00:23.120
about here.

00:23.870 --> 00:24.830
So quick diagram.

00:25.400 --> 00:25.670
All right.

00:25.670 --> 00:27.200
So this is kind of a crazy diagram.

00:27.200 --> 00:33.160
Its purpose is to try to show all the different things that we can effectively do inside the indexed

00:33.470 --> 00:34.040
file.

00:34.350 --> 00:37.700
And I know that's weird to say, but let's just kind of walk to the diagram step by step.

00:37.730 --> 00:40.520
So I'm going to zoom in a little bit here and go up to the top.

00:41.300 --> 00:46.400
So inside of our index file, we've got an import statement for our company class.

00:46.700 --> 00:50.300
Now, we currently have that commented out, but we could very easily uncomment it.

00:50.660 --> 00:55.610
With our company class, we have two things that we can effectively do with it.

00:55.970 --> 00:58.400
We can use it to create a new instance of a company.

00:58.730 --> 01:02.930
And then with that instance of a company, we can reference its company name, catch, phrase, latitude,

01:02.930 --> 01:03.680
longitude.

01:04.630 --> 01:07.000
Likewise, we've got the user class as well.

01:07.820 --> 01:10.940
It's currently commented out, but whatever, we can easily uncomment it.

01:11.830 --> 01:16.960
With the user class, we can create a new instance of it or then reference that instances name latitude

01:16.960 --> 01:17.830
and longitude.

01:18.100 --> 01:23.770
So I'm just trying to describe like the total surface area of what we can do inside that index file

01:23.770 --> 01:24.370
right now.

01:24.580 --> 01:27.580
And so that's basically what we can do with the company and the user.

01:27.850 --> 01:32.080
Now, there technically are other methods available to us, like, you know, the name properties,

01:32.080 --> 01:35.030
a string that has like a to uppercase method and so on.

01:35.050 --> 01:39.970
I'm just trying to write out or diagram out all the different things that we've added into our application

01:39.970 --> 01:42.250
that's specific to our application.

01:42.990 --> 01:47.850
So in other words, the surface area of the company and the user classes is quite small.

01:48.420 --> 01:50.720
Let's now start to think about that map we just created.

01:50.730 --> 01:53.010
However, I'm going to zoom back out just a little bit.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.160
So in the last video, we created that Google map, right?

01:56.430 --> 02:00.990
So we said right here, we said new Google Maps, maps map.

02:01.140 --> 02:03.780
This creates an instance of a map right here.

02:03.780 --> 02:07.170
We could technically assign the result of that to a variable.

02:08.340 --> 02:09.300
Like so.

02:10.120 --> 02:15.220
And then down here we could write out map and try to call a bunch of different methods attached to that

02:15.220 --> 02:16.110
Google map we created.

02:16.120 --> 02:20.470
So if I put a doubt right there, I'll see all the different methods that are attached to a map.

02:20.710 --> 02:25.810
So I see add listener find to change fit bounds, get get bounds, all that different thing.

02:25.810 --> 02:29.200
So those are all different methods we actually saw inside the type definition file.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.430
So another way of seeing all those different methods would once again to be to command click on map

02:33.430 --> 02:36.700
right there and you'll see all those same functions listed out right here.

02:36.700 --> 02:40.240
These are all functions that belong to that instance of a map.

02:40.840 --> 02:44.230
And so those are what these boxes all represent size diagram right here.

02:44.230 --> 02:48.610
So we've got methods like set, zoom, set, center set, street view and so on.

02:49.090 --> 02:50.560
So why is this relevant?

02:50.950 --> 02:54.760
Well, this is going to seem like a weird thing, but I just want to point it out.

02:55.210 --> 03:00.130
These are all methods that we have exposed inside of our index file.

03:00.340 --> 03:06.250
So if another engineer started to come into our project, they could look at that map variable and say,

03:06.250 --> 03:09.130
Oh, hey, look at these cool methods attached to the map.

03:09.130 --> 03:11.830
You know what I feel like just starting to call them.

03:12.070 --> 03:17.530
So another engineer might come into our project, start calling the methods associated with that map,

03:17.530 --> 03:20.680
and very easily break our application.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.870
I know that sounds strange.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.740
I know that's weird.

03:23.740 --> 03:26.040
Like, that's the job of Google Maps, right?

03:26.050 --> 03:29.080
Google Maps is here to expose all these different methods.

03:29.500 --> 03:35.470
My only point is that you and I, as the sole developers of this application, have not vetted these

03:35.470 --> 03:35.830
methods.

03:35.830 --> 03:40.480
We haven't sat down and said, Oh yeah, if you call these things, our application is going to continue

03:40.480 --> 03:41.850
to work perfectly.

03:41.860 --> 03:43.060
We didn't do that.

03:43.240 --> 03:48.880
So in theory, if someone started to call these methods, it might horribly break our application.

03:50.250 --> 03:50.760
Again.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.720
I know this sounds like a stretch, but let me just make a suggestion.

03:55.110 --> 04:02.160
Maybe if we found out a way to limit other engineers access to these methods right here, maybe that

04:02.160 --> 04:07.020
would just slightly decrease the chances of our application breaking horribly.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.180
So here's what I'm going to suggest.

04:09.890 --> 04:16.280
Maybe we start to like firm up or limit the number of things we can do inside the indexed file.

04:16.310 --> 04:22.310
Maybe we say the only things you can do inside of this file is create a new company, reference its

04:22.310 --> 04:25.760
properties, create a new user, reference its properties.

04:26.120 --> 04:32.000
And then maybe we should create a new class called Map like our own custom map class.

04:33.120 --> 04:37.620
And this custom map class can be used to create a new instance of a Google map.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.580
So this right here like will create a new instance of map, to be precise.

04:41.580 --> 04:44.520
And during that process, we can create a new instance of a Google map.

04:44.700 --> 04:50.580
And also on that map class, we can add a method called add marker and we'll use that function right

04:50.580 --> 04:52.330
there to achieve our original goal.

04:52.350 --> 04:56.610
This application of showing a marker for user and company on the actual map.

04:57.340 --> 05:01.270
So again, this class right here, you and I are going to create this is maybe a better name for it.

05:01.270 --> 05:03.130
Be like custom map like so.

05:03.910 --> 05:09.550
So then wrapped up inside this class, we will have some logic to create a Google map.

05:10.140 --> 05:16.230
And the important thing here is that that Google map and all of its associated dangerous functions and

05:16.230 --> 05:21.330
methods right here will not be easily exposed inside of our indexed file.

05:21.660 --> 05:27.120
And so if another engineer came in to our project, they can't just open up that indexed file and start

05:27.120 --> 05:30.000
calling random methods on the Google map.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.400
Instead, we've hidden all those methods.

05:32.400 --> 05:38.790
We've wrapped them all up and taken them away from engineers and hidden them behind this facade of sorts,

05:38.790 --> 05:42.120
or this kind of like black box of custom map.

05:42.330 --> 05:46.530
And the only thing you can do with custom map is create a new map and add a marker to it.

05:47.540 --> 05:47.960
Again.

05:47.960 --> 05:52.550
I know this sounds like a stretch, but the whole idea here is that if we have a program where these

05:52.550 --> 05:58.220
are like the only things you can do, chances are it's going to be way more challenging for people to

05:58.220 --> 06:00.650
come into our app and start to break things.

06:01.490 --> 06:01.760
All right.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.130
So let's take a quick pause right here.

06:03.140 --> 06:09.110
When we come back, the next video, we're going to start to extract this logic to create a Google map

06:09.110 --> 06:11.840
right here into a new class.

06:11.840 --> 06:16.970
And once again, this logic to create a Google map is going to wrap up all of that stuff or something.

06:16.970 --> 06:22.070
Our new class is going to wrap up the Google map and try to hide its existence from other engineers

06:22.070 --> 06:24.680
so they can't accidentally break our application.

06:25.420 --> 06:25.690
All right.

06:25.690 --> 06:26.690
So quick pause right here.

06:26.710 --> 06:28.270
Take care of that in the next video.
