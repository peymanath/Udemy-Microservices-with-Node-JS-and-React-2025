In this video.

00:01.320 --> 00:04.970
We're going to do a quick wrap up on arrays and discuss when we're going to use them.

00:04.980 --> 00:07.740
Well, pretty simple and straightforward, as you might guess.

00:07.740 --> 00:13.050
We're going to use an array in TypeScript any time we want to represent a collection of records, usually

00:13.050 --> 00:14.850
with some very similar type about them.

00:15.270 --> 00:17.730
Now, this might seem like a silly lecture to put in here.

00:17.730 --> 00:22.320
Like, I'm sure you've got a good idea of when to use a raise, but it turns out that there is another

00:22.320 --> 00:28.560
very similar data structure in TypeScript, very similar to arrays called tuples or tuples.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.110
So we're going to talk about tuples in just a second.

00:31.110 --> 00:35.910
And they're going to look very similar to arrays, but with some distinct little differences about them.

00:36.300 --> 00:40.650
So right now, I just want you to understand that we're going to continue to use arrays any time we

00:40.650 --> 00:43.710
want to represent a collection of different records.

00:44.430 --> 00:44.640
All right.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.570
So let's take a pause right here.

00:45.570 --> 00:49.350
When we come back in the next section, we're going to start discussing tuples and how they're just

00:49.350 --> 00:51.300
slightly different from arrays.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.430
It's a quick pause, and I'll see you in just a minute.
