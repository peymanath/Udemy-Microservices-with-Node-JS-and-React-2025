00:00.900 --> 00:01.440
In this video.

00:01.440 --> 00:04.710
We're going to continue by implementing our ad company marker method.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.200
So I'm still inside of my custom app class.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.460
I'm down here at the bottom.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.800
I'm going to expand the method definition.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.020
We're going to create another marker inside of here.

00:13.260 --> 00:18.120
Now, as you might guess, the marker code is going to look awfully similar to what we just did.

00:18.510 --> 00:23.580
The only difference is that we're now pulling the latitude and longitude off of an instance of a company

00:23.580 --> 00:24.810
as opposed to a user.

00:26.100 --> 00:32.070
So I'm going to add in new Google Maps dot marker, capital marker.

00:34.330 --> 00:36.460
We're going to give this thing an options object.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.080
It's going to have a map property.

00:38.080 --> 00:42.250
That is a reference to the map that we want to add the marker to, which will be this Google map.

00:43.160 --> 00:47.450
And we also have that position property that's going to have a latitude coming from our company.

00:47.750 --> 00:55.180
That would be company, location, lat and a longitude company coming from company dot location dot

00:55.250 --> 00:56.510
LNG like so.

00:57.820 --> 00:58.450
All right.

00:58.450 --> 00:59.680
So I'm going to save this.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.720
And right away you're going to notice that these two methods right here look awfully darn similar,

01:04.720 --> 01:05.340
don't they?

01:05.350 --> 01:05.710
Huh?

01:05.740 --> 01:06.790
That's kind of funny.

01:07.270 --> 01:11.320
Well, before we start to obsess over that too much, let's make sure we can actually show a market

01:11.320 --> 01:12.100
for a company.

01:12.370 --> 01:14.470
So I'm going to go back over to indexes.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.380
I'm going to uncomment our import for company.

01:18.170 --> 01:20.630
Right underneath my user, I'll create a company.

01:23.690 --> 01:26.600
And we can use that company and add it as a marker.

01:26.630 --> 01:33.950
So custom map, add company marker and I'll pass in my company like so.

01:35.710 --> 01:40.040
So let's save this flip back over to the browser again and just make sure we can see our marker.

01:40.060 --> 01:40.420
Yep.

01:40.420 --> 01:40.730
Sure.

01:40.750 --> 01:41.260
Can.

01:42.820 --> 01:45.220
All right, so we got both our markers to display.

01:45.340 --> 01:51.730
But like I said, well, our custom map file or our class doesn't have the best format right now.

01:52.210 --> 01:55.060
So this right here, this ends the bad code we've written.

01:55.270 --> 01:58.960
So from here on out, we're going to discuss how to fix the bad code we have inside of here.

01:59.380 --> 02:02.860
First off, let's make sure it's really clear what is bad about this.

02:03.280 --> 02:09.570
So the very bad thing here is that we've got two different methods that very clearly have, you know,

02:09.580 --> 02:11.430
a ton of duplication between them.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.200
The only difference is that in this case, we are accepting a user.

02:14.230 --> 02:16.270
In this case, we are accepting a company.

02:16.660 --> 02:21.880
Now, it sure would be great if we could just take in like one method and say, Hey, as long as you

02:21.880 --> 02:26.440
are passing in something that has like a latitude and longitude, everything is going to work out just

02:26.440 --> 02:27.010
fine.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.690
And that's exactly what we want to do.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.740
We're going to take these two methods and figure out how to condense them down to just one.

02:33.340 --> 02:34.600
So let's take a quick pause right here.

02:34.600 --> 02:38.020
We're going to come back to the next video and take a look at a couple of diagrams to understand how

02:38.020 --> 02:42.430
we're going to do this by using interfaces and what the implication of it is.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.650
So quick break and I'll see you in just a minute.
