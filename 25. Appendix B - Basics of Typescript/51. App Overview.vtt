WEBVTT

00:00.910 --> 00:05.590
All right, my friends, many videos ago I told you that we were going to spend a lot of time learning

00:05.590 --> 00:07.400
the basic syntax of TypeScript.

00:07.420 --> 00:11.710
We've now gone through all that basic stuff, and we've got a reasonable understanding of some of the

00:11.710 --> 00:13.210
low levels of TypeScript.

00:13.240 --> 00:17.830
But I think it's very fair to say that we still don't really understand how to build an application

00:17.830 --> 00:18.400
with it.

00:18.640 --> 00:22.810
So starting this video, we're going to work on our first application and throughout the rest of this

00:22.810 --> 00:26.080
course, all we're going to focus on is design patterns.

00:26.350 --> 00:31.060
We're going to learn how to use TypeScript effectively inside of an application and how to leverage

00:31.060 --> 00:33.640
its features to write really reusable code.

00:33.940 --> 00:37.720
So let's talk about what we're going to build for our first application.

00:38.410 --> 00:38.860
All right.

00:38.860 --> 00:41.530
So here it is, Mockup.

00:42.130 --> 00:42.400
All right.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.370
So we're going to make a very basic little Web application.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.310
So this is going to be something that's going to run inside of your browser.

00:48.760 --> 00:52.960
Our application is going to randomly generate two different entities.

00:53.230 --> 00:57.190
It's going to randomly generate a user and randomly generate a company.

00:57.700 --> 01:01.870
Now, when I say randomly generate, all I mean is that we're going to have a user with a randomly generated

01:01.870 --> 01:05.170
name and last name and age and stuff like that.

01:05.500 --> 01:10.120
And our company will have a random name and a random business and some stuff like that as well.

01:11.370 --> 01:16.170
Every user in every company is going to have a location property tied to it as well.

01:16.170 --> 01:19.050
So this is going to be like a longitude and latitude.

01:19.870 --> 01:25.000
After we generate the user and the company, we're going to use that location to show them as markers

01:25.000 --> 01:27.100
on a Google map inside the browser.

01:27.460 --> 01:31.980
So this marker right here, I know it's kind of hard to see what these colors might represent the user

01:31.990 --> 01:34.810
and this over here might represent the company.

01:35.510 --> 01:41.210
So the entire goal of this application is to get you more familiar with classes and how to understand

01:41.210 --> 01:47.420
how to make use of interfaces really effectively to get some amount of code reuse on the applications

01:47.420 --> 01:48.140
you work on.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.070
That's the whole goal.

01:49.070 --> 01:54.620
And like I said, that's pretty much the whole goal of the entire course understanding classes and interfaces.

01:55.280 --> 01:55.550
All right.

01:55.550 --> 01:59.210
So now that we understand what's going on here, we're going to do just a tiny bit of setup inside this

01:59.210 --> 02:03.090
video in order to actually get some typescript code running inside the browser.

02:03.110 --> 02:06.590
Very easily, we're going to use a tool called parcel bundler.

02:06.980 --> 02:11.210
This is a command line tool that we're going to use in place of node.

02:11.570 --> 02:16.730
Parcel bundler is all about getting some TypeScript executed inside the browser very easily, so it's

02:16.730 --> 02:18.950
going to automate a lot of tooling for us.

02:19.310 --> 02:23.870
We will eventually learn how to set up a TypeScript project manually, but for right now, we're going

02:23.870 --> 02:26.270
to start off nice and easy using parcel.

02:26.900 --> 02:30.470
So to set up parcel, all we have to do is run this command at our terminal.

02:30.770 --> 02:36.890
So I'm going to flip over to my terminal right now and I'll do an NPM install dash G parcel dash bundler

02:36.890 --> 02:37.580
like so.

02:39.020 --> 02:42.650
This is going to take a minute or two to install, so I'm going to let it do its thing and I'll join

02:42.650 --> 02:44.360
back up with you in just a minute.
