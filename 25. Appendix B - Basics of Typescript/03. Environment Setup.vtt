WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:03.530
In this video, we're going to do a little bit of environment setup.

00:03.540 --> 00:08.280
Once we set up our local machine to work with, TypeScript will then begin working on our first project.

00:08.280 --> 00:09.600
So let's get to it.

00:10.490 --> 00:13.250
The first thing we'll do is to install the TypeScript compiler.

00:13.310 --> 00:15.340
To install it, we're going to use NPM.

00:15.570 --> 00:19.580
If you're here in this course, I'm going to assume that you've got a basic understanding of both Node

00:19.580 --> 00:20.720
and PM.

00:20.930 --> 00:26.120
So I'm going to assume in particular that you've already got Node in NPM installed on your local system.

00:26.660 --> 00:30.860
If you don't, you'll want to do a quick Google search on how to install Node on your local machine.

00:30.890 --> 00:34.130
Again, I'm really assuming that you've got that knowledge ahead of time.

00:34.970 --> 00:39.320
So we're going to use NPM to install TypeScript as a global module.

00:39.350 --> 00:43.040
We're also going to install a second module called TS Node.

00:43.550 --> 00:48.560
To US, Node is a little command line tool that allows us to compile and execute TypeScript with one

00:48.560 --> 00:49.910
command at our terminal.

00:49.940 --> 00:54.050
We're going to use it in the first half of this course just for running some typescript very quickly

00:54.050 --> 00:57.590
without having to set up a full tooling installation kind of deal.

00:57.830 --> 00:58.970
So let's get to it.

00:59.330 --> 01:02.230
I'm going to open up my terminal once over here.

01:02.240 --> 01:09.860
I'm going to run NPM, install DAG and I'll get TypeScript and TS Node like so.

01:11.090 --> 01:11.330
All right.

01:11.330 --> 01:14.690
So that's going to take just a moment or two to install rather quickly.

01:14.690 --> 01:19.130
Once it is installed, I can then make sure that it is successfully installed and then I can run the

01:19.130 --> 01:20.420
compiler by running.

01:20.420 --> 01:21.380
Tsk.

01:21.710 --> 01:22.070
Dash.

01:22.070 --> 01:23.750
Dash help like so.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.950
So we installed a package called TypeScript.

01:28.140 --> 01:33.480
It gives us access to a command called Tsk, which is short for, as you might guess, TypeScript compiler.

01:33.510 --> 01:38.550
This is what we're going to use to actually compile our TypeScript code into plain JavaScript.

01:39.230 --> 01:43.460
So if I run this command, I should see a bunch of help messages up here on the screen.

01:43.460 --> 01:49.100
Like, so if you see any error, that means that your NPM installation probably has a little issue and

01:49.100 --> 01:50.990
you'll need to do a little bit of troubleshooting.

01:51.800 --> 01:51.970
Okay.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.340
So that's pretty much it for the actual typescript set up.

01:55.580 --> 02:01.190
Now we're going to walk through a little additional setup here for setting up Visual Studio code.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.930
Now, this is a code editor.

02:02.930 --> 02:05.490
If you've already got Visual Studio code installed.

02:05.510 --> 02:09.560
I encourage you to still watch this video because I'm going to show you some settings that are important

02:09.560 --> 02:10.460
for you to have.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.990
If you want to use another code editor inside this course, that's totally fine.

02:15.020 --> 02:20.060
I've tried out many other code editors, and personally I think that Visual Studio code is one of the

02:20.060 --> 02:22.400
best ones out there for working with TypeScript.

02:22.580 --> 02:26.000
So if you've never used it, I would recommend at least try it one time.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.750
So I'm going to go through the installation process here really quickly.

02:30.110 --> 02:34.490
Well, first, go to that link inside of a new browser tab and I'll find the green download button on

02:34.490 --> 02:35.510
the left hand side.

02:36.890 --> 02:40.190
Once I download this zip file, I'll then open it up.

02:41.670 --> 02:43.530
That's going to extract it.

02:44.420 --> 02:46.520
Here's the Visual Studio code application.

02:46.700 --> 02:51.170
And if you're on Mac, all you have to do is drag and drop that into the applications folder.

02:51.680 --> 02:54.780
If you're on Windows, you're going to instead see a little installer.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.390
All you have to do is go through the installation process.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.970
It's just a couple of clicks.

03:00.050 --> 03:04.730
Now that we've got the code installed, we're going to do just a couple steps of configuration.

03:05.090 --> 03:06.700
So this is what we're going to go through.

03:06.710 --> 03:11.540
I'm mostly showing you these configuration steps, just you understand the exact settings that I'm running

03:11.540 --> 03:12.230
locally.

03:12.890 --> 03:18.830
Now, just to be clear, I just did a fresh installation of VS code, like I completely deleted my previous

03:18.830 --> 03:19.640
installation.

03:20.030 --> 03:24.500
So when I go through these settings, you're going to see a fresh installation being set up here.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.170
So I don't have any previous setup whatsoever.

03:28.070 --> 03:28.310
All right.

03:28.310 --> 03:29.300
So let's get to it.

03:29.750 --> 03:32.600
The first thing I'm going to do is open up Visual Studio code.

03:35.190 --> 03:39.330
And it's going to take just a moment this first time that it boots up to actually open so it's going

03:39.330 --> 03:40.320
to let it do its thing.

03:42.180 --> 03:42.600
All right.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.320
There we go.

03:47.070 --> 03:47.310
All right.

03:47.310 --> 03:51.990
So once I've got Visual Studio code open, we're going to go through each of these different setup steps

03:51.990 --> 03:52.710
right here.

03:53.130 --> 03:57.300
So the first thing I'm going to do is set up code in my path variable.

03:57.690 --> 04:02.220
And what this essentially does is allow me to launch my code editor from the terminal, which I'm going

04:02.220 --> 04:04.050
to be doing quite a bit throughout this course.

04:04.500 --> 04:10.890
So to do so, I'm going to go over to the editor and then I'll go up to view and then find command palette.

04:11.670 --> 04:16.280
And then once here I'm going to search for add path, actually not add path.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.750
I think it's install path.

04:17.760 --> 04:18.600
Yeah, there we go.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.910
So install a code command in path.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.470
All we have to do is click that and that's pretty much it.

04:23.490 --> 04:25.320
We'll see a little notification down here.

04:26.060 --> 04:29.660
If I now flip on over to my terminal, I can open up a new window.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.010
Make sure you open up a new window.

04:31.010 --> 04:34.490
If you try to run this command in an existing window, it's probably going to fail.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.800
And then once over here, you can open up your code editor in any directory by running code and then

04:39.800 --> 04:40.460
dot like.

04:40.460 --> 04:44.300
So now as you'll see, it'll pop open my code editor right away.

04:45.710 --> 04:45.980
All right.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.920
So let's keep going through these installation steps.

04:47.930 --> 04:49.550
The other ones are going to be pretty quick.

04:49.910 --> 04:53.030
So the next one is going to be to install the prettier extension.

04:53.740 --> 04:55.230
Prettier is a code formatter.

04:55.240 --> 04:59.920
It's going to take a look at your code every time you save a file and automatically format it in some

04:59.920 --> 05:01.180
fixed fashion.

05:01.390 --> 05:04.990
So I usually use pretty or just have some very consistent looking code.

05:04.990 --> 05:07.120
Now I highly recommend you try it out as well.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.110
To install this extension.

05:09.110 --> 05:10.790
I'll go back over to my editor.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.440
I'll find a view.

05:13.330 --> 05:15.190
Well, then look for extensions.

05:16.100 --> 05:19.250
And then on the left hand side, I'll search for prettier.

05:20.730 --> 05:24.960
And it's going to be the first one right here by SBN Pettersson.

05:25.410 --> 05:26.520
So I'll hit install.

05:27.530 --> 05:28.880
And that's pretty much it.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.530
Now we're going to do a little bit of configuration on Prettier.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.670
We're going to make sure first that it formats every file when we save it.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.250
So to do so, I'll go back over.

05:39.790 --> 05:42.040
I'm going to again go to my view menu.

05:43.090 --> 05:46.270
And then I'm going to look for excuse me not view.

05:46.270 --> 05:49.600
I'm looking for preferences or code preferences settings.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.350
There it is.

05:52.880 --> 05:57.920
And then once I've got the settings tab up right here, I'll do a search for format.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.470
On Save.

06:01.190 --> 06:04.070
And I'll see a setting right here called format on Save.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.950
So we just have to check that and that's pretty much it.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.940
Next up, I'm going to configure prettier to use single quotes.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.950
Now, this is entirely personal.

06:13.950 --> 06:16.120
If you want to use double quotes, totally fine.

06:16.140 --> 06:19.200
You can use either single quotes or double quotes safely.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.660
With TypeScript, I just prefer single quotes.

06:21.930 --> 06:27.270
So to set up prettier to format my code in that fashion, I'll go back over to my settings page.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.880
I'll look for single quotes.

06:31.260 --> 06:36.120
And I'll scroll down just a little bit right here and I'll see a setting called prettier single quote

06:36.120 --> 06:37.200
and check it.

06:39.960 --> 06:40.260
All right.

06:40.260 --> 06:45.300
Next one is I'm going to make sure that I use two spaces for indentation as opposed to tabs.

06:45.330 --> 06:46.880
Again, this is very personal.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.010
You can go either way.

06:48.030 --> 06:54.330
I personally like to use two spaces for indentation, so to do so, I'm going to delete the search term

06:54.330 --> 06:54.930
up here.

06:56.050 --> 07:01.390
And then scroll down on the default settings here just a little bit and I should see tab size right

07:01.390 --> 07:01.990
here.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.140
And let's change it to two like so.

07:08.400 --> 07:08.700
All right.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.970
So last thing I'm going to set my theme to be solar light.

07:11.970 --> 07:15.030
So that's just going to change the coloring of my editor a little bit.

07:15.690 --> 07:19.590
So to do so, I'm going to go back over once again, I'll look for theme.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.280
I'll find color theme right here.

07:22.310 --> 07:26.870
Right now the default is dark and I'm going to change it to solar light instead.

07:27.960 --> 07:28.740
And that's it.

07:29.910 --> 07:30.220
Okay.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.280
Now, one last little thing I'm going to do here.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.680
I am going to hide this bar on the left hand side.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.310
I can find that setting by looking up activity bar.

07:39.540 --> 07:43.170
So workbench activity bar visible and I'm just going to deselect that.

07:43.170 --> 07:44.910
So that little bar on the side goes away.

07:45.810 --> 07:46.680
All right, so that's it.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.930
That's all the configuration I do to my editor.

07:48.930 --> 07:53.250
So if you went through these steps, you now have an editor that's set up identically to mine.

07:53.580 --> 07:57.030
So now that we've got everything set up for our local environment, let's take a quick pause right here,

07:57.030 --> 07:59.340
and we're going to start writing some code in the next video.
