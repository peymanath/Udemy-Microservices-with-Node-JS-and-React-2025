Hello and welcome.

00:01.830 --> 00:06.360
My name is Stephen Grider and I'm really excited to teach you everything I know about TypeScript.

00:06.570 --> 00:10.950
But before we get started, I just want you to know how you can get help if you ever get stuck inside

00:10.950 --> 00:11.730
this course.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.320
So if you ever run into some trouble and you're having a little bit of difficulty with troubleshooting,

00:16.320 --> 00:19.230
make sure you check out these different sources for getting help.

00:19.470 --> 00:24.420
The first place to check is the Udemy Q&amp;A discussion boards that are here inside this course.

00:25.050 --> 00:29.340
You can also reach out to me via direct message on Udemy as well.

00:29.430 --> 00:34.110
And finally, if you need some really fast response, you can also get a hold of me on Twitter.

00:34.110 --> 00:38.910
But just be aware that if you message me on Twitter, it's sometimes a little bit challenging to communicate

00:38.910 --> 00:39.420
on there.

00:39.420 --> 00:43.920
So in general, best to ask questions on the discussion boards or via direct message.

00:44.400 --> 00:50.310
Just, you know, I usually check messages on all these different channels once a time, once per day

00:50.340 --> 00:56.130
on Monday through Friday, Friday, around nine or ten or 11 Mountain Standard Time.

00:56.130 --> 00:58.500
So that's usually when you're going to get a response from me.

00:58.860 --> 01:03.060
Okay, so let's take a quick pause right here and start discussing TypeScript in the next video.
