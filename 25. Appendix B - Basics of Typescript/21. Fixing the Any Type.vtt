00:00.920 --> 00:05.240
In the last video we spoke about why the any type is a very bad thing to have inside of application

00:05.420 --> 00:11.720
right now coordinates is of type any and it's only the case because JSON parse returns a value of type

00:11.720 --> 00:16.700
any and that's because TypeScript just can't predict what JSON Parse is going to return.

00:17.180 --> 00:22.580
So to fix this up, one way we could fix it is to add in a type annotation for coordinates.

00:23.450 --> 00:27.050
So we need to add in a type annotation for an object.

00:27.290 --> 00:32.480
We already saw an example of that right back up here when we defined the object literal of point.

00:33.020 --> 00:38.000
So to add in a type annotation for an object right after the variable name, we're put in that colon

00:38.270 --> 00:41.150
and then the overall structure of that object.

00:41.830 --> 00:44.260
So for us, we're going to add in coordinates right here.

00:44.260 --> 00:47.410
I'll put in a colon then instead of curly braces.

00:47.410 --> 00:52.360
And inside there I'm going to say this thing is going to have a property called X that is a number and

00:52.360 --> 00:55.330
it's going to have a property Y that is a number as well.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.520
So now we've given enough information to TypeScript that it can figure out what type of value coordinates

01:01.520 --> 01:02.390
is by now.

01:02.420 --> 01:03.190
Mouse over it.

01:03.200 --> 01:07.820
I see the type annotation on here and now if I try to reference a coordinates.

01:08.090 --> 01:09.110
Blah blah blah.

01:09.140 --> 01:14.000
I'll very quickly see an error message that tells me that is not a property on that object.

01:14.840 --> 01:15.070
Okay.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.020
So that's pretty much it.

01:16.040 --> 01:21.290
This is one of the three cases where we are going to add in type annotations any time we call a function

01:21.290 --> 01:22.700
that returns type any.

01:23.210 --> 01:27.220
Now, JSON parse is just one of the functions in JavaScript that returns type any.

01:27.230 --> 01:28.880
There are several others as well.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.850
So we'll kind of see some of those different functions over time.

01:31.850 --> 01:36.080
And in fact we might eventually have to write our own functions that return type any as well.

01:36.950 --> 01:37.190
All right.

01:37.190 --> 01:38.420
So let's take a quick pause right here.

01:38.420 --> 01:39.620
When we come back, the next video.

01:39.650 --> 01:46.370
We'll move on to the next example or the next case where we are going to add in a type annotation willingly.

01:46.370 --> 01:48.680
So quick pause and I'll see you in just a minute.
