00:01.160 --> 00:05.180
Now that we finished up our first application, I want to give you a quick overview on how this course

00:05.180 --> 00:05.990
is structured.

00:06.200 --> 00:09.890
Now, as soon as I say that, you might be looking for the skip button and trying to skip over to the

00:09.890 --> 00:10.830
next video.

00:10.850 --> 00:12.830
But I beg you, please stick around.

00:12.830 --> 00:13.730
Just watch this video.

00:13.740 --> 00:15.980
I'm going to make it as short as I possibly can.

00:16.010 --> 00:20.360
It's really important you watch this video because it's going to really frame how you approach and learn

00:20.360 --> 00:21.080
TypeScript.

00:21.260 --> 00:24.200
So let me just dive right in so I don't waste any time.

00:25.100 --> 00:25.370
All right.

00:25.370 --> 00:29.240
So when we think about learning the TypeScript language, there's really two distinct categories of

00:29.240 --> 00:30.380
knowledge that we need.

00:30.740 --> 00:34.550
On the one hand, we need to understand the syntax and features of the language.

00:34.730 --> 00:38.120
So, for example, we need to understand what an interface is.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.410
Where do we use an interface?

00:39.410 --> 00:40.370
How do we use it?

00:40.760 --> 00:44.480
And we also need to understand the syntax for defining an interface as well.

00:45.340 --> 00:48.250
So that's kind of like one category of knowledge we have to pick up.

00:48.700 --> 00:52.900
The other category of knowledge we have to pick up is design patterns using TypeScript.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.890
So it's not enough to just know what an interface is.

00:55.900 --> 01:01.540
I want you to understand how to use an interface to actually write some amount of reusable code.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.050
This is the big focus of this course.

01:04.060 --> 01:06.860
This is what I really want to focus the entire course on.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.190
I want you to understand design patterns.

01:09.670 --> 01:14.440
At the end of the day, the official documentation is actually pretty strong for TypeScript, and you

01:14.440 --> 01:19.420
could understand some basic syntax and features pretty darn well by reading that documentation.

01:19.930 --> 01:23.290
So because of that, that's why I want to focus on design patterns.

01:23.740 --> 01:25.150
So why am I telling you this?

01:25.600 --> 01:26.710
Well, to be honest.

01:27.570 --> 01:29.100
The course you're watching right now.

01:29.130 --> 01:33.570
I've been working on for about six weeks, like six weeks of full time work.

01:33.570 --> 01:40.500
I've been working on this course and I've recorded about a total of 20 hours of content for this course

01:40.500 --> 01:42.510
up to this point, like in the last six weeks.

01:42.510 --> 01:44.700
And I've thrown it all away.

01:44.880 --> 01:45.840
Why is that?

01:46.200 --> 01:51.300
Well, I tried to initially design this course to focus 100% on design patterns and just pick up some

01:51.300 --> 01:53.130
syntax and features along the way.

01:53.400 --> 01:58.950
And it turns out after all these six weeks of time working on this, it just doesn't work to pick up

01:58.950 --> 02:00.240
TypeScript in that fashion.

02:00.570 --> 02:05.640
Honestly, the most effective way to pick up TypeScript correctly or very quickly is to first focus

02:05.640 --> 02:11.790
on the syntax and features with some kind of like dry, boring lectures and then start to focus on the

02:11.790 --> 02:12.930
design patterns.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.400
So here's what we're going to do.

02:14.430 --> 02:19.740
We're going to focus on the basic syntax and features and then start to move on to some projects where

02:19.740 --> 02:22.230
we're going to focus on understanding design patterns.

02:22.710 --> 02:26.820
Now, the reason I'm showing you this and I'm telling you all this stuff is that in the coming videos,

02:26.820 --> 02:32.310
as we start to focus on syntax and features, some of them are going to be honestly kind of boring.

02:32.390 --> 02:36.300
Now I'm going to make it as interesting as I can, but when we are just talking about plain syntax,

02:36.300 --> 02:41.340
we have to work with like tiny little toy examples that just don't reflect the real world a lot of the

02:41.340 --> 02:41.850
time.

02:42.550 --> 02:44.570
So I would love to skip over this stuff.

02:44.590 --> 02:49.680
I would love to just ignore syntax and features, but we have to do it just unequivocally.

02:49.690 --> 02:51.760
You have to understand the syntax.

02:52.090 --> 02:56.230
So we're going to blaze through this stuff as quickly as we can, and then we're going to move on to

02:56.230 --> 03:00.400
the design patterns where we're going to be working on a bunch of projects that will really show you

03:00.400 --> 03:03.340
how to leverage TypeScript to write reusable code.

03:04.300 --> 03:04.660
All right.

03:04.660 --> 03:08.920
So having said all that, as we're going through these early sections around syntax and whatnot, if

03:08.920 --> 03:11.320
you're getting bored, totally fine.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.110
Just skip ahead and go take a look at some of the projects.

03:14.350 --> 03:19.030
If you start working on a project and you realize, Oh my gosh, I've got no idea what's going on here,

03:19.030 --> 03:23.800
you can always go back and take a look at the lectures on features and syntax and whatnot.

03:24.820 --> 03:26.110
So thank you for sticking around.

03:26.110 --> 03:28.030
If you did, let's take a pause right now.

03:28.030 --> 03:32.440
When we come back in the next video, we're going to dive into our first kind of features and syntax

03:32.440 --> 03:33.520
style lecture.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.140
So I'll see you in just a minute.
