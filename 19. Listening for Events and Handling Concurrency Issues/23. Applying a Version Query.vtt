00:01.130 --> 00:04.280
Our events now include a version numbers, which is fantastic.

00:04.280 --> 00:08.240
So we're now going to move over to our orders service inside of our order service.

00:08.240 --> 00:13.730
We will eventually wire up that update if current plug in inside of our order model.

00:13.730 --> 00:17.300
But right now we're going to focus on making our ticket work correctly.

00:17.300 --> 00:22.370
So I want to make sure that we wire up that plug in to the ticket model inside of orders.

00:22.400 --> 00:26.660
And I want to make sure that we execute all the appropriate logic inside of the ticket.

00:26.660 --> 00:31.760
Updated Listener So in other words, I want to go through the process that we've described many times

00:31.760 --> 00:36.860
where we receive some kind of event and then we run some kind of query to try to find a ticket with

00:36.860 --> 00:39.920
the same ID and the version minus one.

00:39.920 --> 00:44.720
So in this case version of to subtract one, that gives us one and we would be looking for this version

00:44.720 --> 00:45.440
right here.

00:45.680 --> 00:50.840
We would then apply our updates to this record, and when we save it, we would want to see that version

00:50.840 --> 00:52.940
number automatically incremented for us.

00:53.060 --> 00:54.710
So that is what we're focused on right now.

00:54.710 --> 00:58.760
We want to make sure the ticket updated events get wired up properly.

00:59.390 --> 01:03.770
So to get started, we're going to first install that plug in into our order service and we're going

01:03.770 --> 01:05.000
to do that at the terminal.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.040
So at my terminal.

01:07.940 --> 01:16.460
I'm inside of my orders service directory and I'll do an NP pm install mongoose update if current.

01:19.920 --> 01:20.130
Kat.

01:20.160 --> 01:20.910
So it's pretty small.

01:20.910 --> 01:22.470
Should install it rather quickly.

01:22.500 --> 01:22.860
Yep.

01:22.860 --> 01:23.610
Looks good.

01:24.330 --> 01:28.620
So we'll now go back over to my ticket model file inside of the orders service.

01:29.170 --> 01:30.130
So here's the order service.

01:30.150 --> 01:35.280
I'll find the ticket model file and we're going to wire up the same series of steps that we had done

01:35.280 --> 01:38.190
back inside the ticket file inside of our ticket service.

01:38.370 --> 01:43.680
We're going to import the plug in at the top, wired up to the schema and list this new version property

01:43.680 --> 01:45.960
inside of our ticket dock interface.

01:46.900 --> 01:51.700
So at the very top we will begin by importing update if current plugin.

01:52.730 --> 01:55.940
From Mongoose update if current.

01:58.390 --> 01:59.770
I'll then go down to my schema.

01:59.770 --> 02:02.230
So here's ticket schema right after it.

02:03.240 --> 02:08.220
We'll put in to get schema set version, key and version.

02:09.580 --> 02:13.840
And then ticket schema plugin update if current.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.430
Plug in like so.

02:19.020 --> 02:21.720
Then finally up inside of our ticket doc interface.

02:22.820 --> 02:24.590
We'll add in the version property.

02:25.820 --> 02:27.150
And again, this is just here.

02:27.150 --> 02:31.920
So we can eventually write out code like ticket version without having TypeScript complain at us.

02:33.420 --> 02:33.670
Okay.

02:33.690 --> 02:34.280
So that is it.

02:34.290 --> 02:37.770
We are now using this plug in with the ticket model inside the order service.

02:38.070 --> 02:41.540
So now we're going to focus on making our listener work correctly.

02:41.550 --> 02:45.780
We're going to make sure that the ticket updated listener is going to receive these events.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.920
It's going to reach into the database and try to find a record with IDC's.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.660
Q And whatever the event's version is, minus one.

02:53.670 --> 02:56.940
So in this case, we'd be looking for a version of one inside the database.

02:56.970 --> 03:01.290
If we do not find some ticket, we would throw an error and say, Hey, something's wrong here.

03:01.290 --> 03:03.420
We were not able to find the appropriate ticket.

03:05.910 --> 03:10.770
So inside of our Events Listeners directory, I'm going to find ticket updated listener.

03:14.710 --> 03:19.150
We're then going to take a look at the query they execute right here and we're going to adjust that

03:19.150 --> 03:19.720
query.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.720
So we're going to make sure that the query we run is what we just described.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.290
Find the ticket with Q and the appropriate version.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.010
So I'm going to remove the fine buy ID.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.940
We can't use that query or that little helper to make the query any more because now we want to make

03:33.940 --> 03:37.930
a query based on two different criteria, both the ID and the version number.

03:38.110 --> 03:40.900
So we're going to change this to a find one.

03:42.250 --> 03:46.330
Well, then put in an object and list the filter or search criteria inside of here.

03:46.420 --> 03:48.670
So we want to find a ticket with an ID.

03:48.700 --> 03:52.150
Notice how its underscore ID of data ID.

03:52.850 --> 03:56.420
And a version of data, version minus one.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.600
If we mouse over a ticket updated event right here or do a command click on it, we should see that

04:04.600 --> 04:06.190
this thing now has the version property.

04:06.190 --> 04:10.540
If you do not see that, you'll want to restart your code editor because remember we did just update

04:10.540 --> 04:11.650
that common module.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.850
So that's where we are getting the version from is contained inside the event.

04:15.870 --> 04:16.290
Now.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.800
So we're going to run that query.

04:18.800 --> 04:24.140
And again for the 20th time inside this course, if we do not find that ticket right there, it means

04:24.140 --> 04:26.720
we must be processing events out of order.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.850
And so an example of that would be if we are on version three too early, we would take version three,

04:31.850 --> 04:35.540
subtract one, that would give us version two, and there's no record inside of our database with the

04:35.540 --> 04:36.320
appropriate version.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.520
So oops, we won't find the ticket and we would end up throwing an error right here or something.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.200
It says Ticket not found.

04:44.030 --> 04:45.050
And that's pretty much it.

04:45.260 --> 04:48.190
So now we can make our updates to the ticket.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.410
We can set the new title and price on there and then save the record.

04:51.440 --> 04:57.530
And once we save that record, that is why we just wired up this update if current plug in to the ticket

04:57.530 --> 04:58.910
model inside the order service.

04:58.910 --> 05:03.650
So when we save this thing, it's going to increment the version to match the version that just came

05:03.650 --> 05:04.670
in the event.

05:07.070 --> 05:07.480
Okay.

05:07.790 --> 05:08.750
That's pretty much it.

05:08.780 --> 05:10.190
Let's save this thing.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.530
And then to test it, we're going to use postman with postman.

05:14.540 --> 05:17.720
We're going to manually create a ticket and then try to update it.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.400
And we're just going to make sure that all of our code for right now runs without any kind of error.

05:21.410 --> 05:25.550
We don't really have anything to verify and say that it's handling concurrency correctly right here.

05:25.550 --> 05:29.330
But we'll take a look at an example of how it's going to fix that stuff in just a little bit.

05:30.160 --> 05:30.250
Yeah.

05:30.390 --> 05:31.530
So inside a postman.

05:35.690 --> 05:40.280
I'm going to first go to my tab where I am making a post request to API tickets.

05:40.820 --> 05:43.580
I am of course going to make sure I'm authenticated really quickly as well.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.080
So API users, current user.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.280
Yep, I'm authenticated.

05:46.910 --> 05:50.870
So post requests to API tickets and I'll put in a title and a price.

05:50.870 --> 05:54.020
I'm going to send that off and here is my created ticket.

05:54.260 --> 05:59.240
If I go over to scaffold really quickly, I should see some event saying something around, Hey, we

05:59.240 --> 06:02.300
have published this event and receive the event as well.

06:02.450 --> 06:04.640
So if we take a look at scaffold really quick.

06:04.640 --> 06:04.970
Yep.

06:04.970 --> 06:05.600
There we go.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.760
Publish ticket created and received.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.630
Ticket created.

06:10.770 --> 06:15.900
So now take the ID of the ticket that I just made, and I'm going to try to make an update to this ticket.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.980
So I'll go over to my put request tab.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.270
Over on this put request tab.

06:23.270 --> 06:26.720
I'll make sure that I am making a put request to API slash tickets.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.230
I'm then going to put in the ID of the record that we just created a moment ago.

06:30.230 --> 06:34.490
So remember, we can get that from the post request tab that ID right there.

06:35.410 --> 06:37.570
I'm going to throw it in at the very end of the URL.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.420
I'll then make sure that there is some new price listed in here.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.970
Then finally, I'm going to send this off.

06:44.000 --> 06:44.160
Okay.

06:44.180 --> 06:46.220
Let's go back over to Scaffold and see how we're doing.

06:46.580 --> 06:51.800
So it looks like I was able to successfully process the created and the update as well.

06:52.160 --> 06:56.420
And in theory, this should now solve a lot of these different concurrency issues.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.740
But it's kind of hard to see that from the limited style of testing that we have right now.

07:01.070 --> 07:02.140
So we going to take a quick pause.

07:02.150 --> 07:05.330
We're going to come back the next video and we're going to try to run that little test script I put

07:05.330 --> 07:10.400
together again and see if there's still any disagreement between the records on our order service and

07:10.400 --> 07:11.540
the ticket service.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.670
So let's take a look at that in just a moment.
