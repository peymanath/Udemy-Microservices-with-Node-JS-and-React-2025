00:01.500 --> 00:01.800
All right.

00:01.800 --> 00:06.180
We're now going to go around our common module, find all of our different events, four in total and

00:06.180 --> 00:09.450
inside of the data property of each of those events, we're going to say that we're going to include

00:09.450 --> 00:12.150
the version number and it's going to be type number.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.910
So we'll start off first with order cancelled.

00:15.150 --> 00:17.640
I'll find the data property right after the ID.

00:17.640 --> 00:20.700
We will include version as a number.

00:21.450 --> 00:23.820
That's going to be the version number of the order itself.

00:24.690 --> 00:25.290
That's it.

00:26.090 --> 00:27.530
Next up, order created.

00:28.470 --> 00:29.550
It's out of order created.

00:29.580 --> 00:32.340
We'll say that this thing is going to include version as a number.

00:33.090 --> 00:33.720
That's it.

00:35.050 --> 00:36.550
We'll go to ticket created.

00:38.150 --> 00:41.120
Add in version number.

00:42.590 --> 00:46.970
And then finally ticket updated add in version number.

00:47.730 --> 00:48.540
And that's it.

00:50.710 --> 00:52.080
So let's now go back over to our terminal.

00:52.090 --> 00:54.230
We're going to go into the common module directory.

00:54.250 --> 00:58.780
We're going to republish this thing and then we will update the version of the common module used inside

00:58.780 --> 01:00.460
of tickets and orders.

01:02.860 --> 01:06.460
Back at my terminal, I'm inside of ticketing, which is our overall project directory.

01:06.490 --> 01:10.060
So I'll change into the common folder and do an NPM run pub.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.060
It looks like I'm on version 20.

01:14.090 --> 01:17.460
You probably are a little bit less, as I mentioned many times.

01:17.480 --> 01:22.580
I've definitely published a couple of extra versions here and there as I've rerecorded videos and whatnot.

01:23.450 --> 01:26.390
So version 20, you're probably going to be on a much lesser version.

01:26.390 --> 01:27.650
Just remember that number.

01:27.980 --> 01:33.020
We're now going to go over to our order service and the ticket service update the common module version

01:33.020 --> 01:33.350
in there.

01:33.350 --> 01:37.040
And we're going to want to just double check, make sure that all these version numbers line up with

01:37.160 --> 01:39.230
whatever version you just saw in your terminal.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.720
So I'll begin first inside of orders.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.260
Inside of orders.

01:43.260 --> 01:46.800
I'll do an NPM update by common module.

01:51.510 --> 01:54.840
So I'm going to expect to see one zero 20 in my case.

01:56.570 --> 01:57.890
And yep, looks good.

01:59.050 --> 02:03.820
Next up, I'll go over to the ticket service and do an NPM update.

02:06.070 --> 02:06.640
Common.

02:12.760 --> 02:13.290
Okay.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.260
So that should be it.

02:14.530 --> 02:15.130
All set?

02:15.880 --> 02:19.840
Well, now that we've got these new event definitions, we're going to go around.

02:19.840 --> 02:24.730
And unfortunately, we're going to make sure that every single time we publish an event, we include

02:24.730 --> 02:25.960
that version number.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.830
So there's going to be a little bit of hunting of code here to make sure that we always pass off the

02:29.830 --> 02:31.270
version number appropriately.

02:31.300 --> 02:34.140
So this is going to include a little bit of hunt and find.

02:34.150 --> 02:37.330
Luckily, we do also have our tests.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.240
Now the tests are not going to necessarily make sure that we include the version number.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.410
It's actually TypeScript that's going to make sure that we include the version number on there.

02:43.420 --> 02:47.440
So if we run the test, chances are we might see some typescript errors, something saying, hey, you

02:47.440 --> 02:50.080
were supposed to include a version property here, but you didn't.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.890
So let's hunt through our ticket service and the order service in the next video.

02:53.890 --> 02:58.180
And every single time we publish an event, we'll just make sure that we always include a version as

02:58.180 --> 02:58.630
well.
