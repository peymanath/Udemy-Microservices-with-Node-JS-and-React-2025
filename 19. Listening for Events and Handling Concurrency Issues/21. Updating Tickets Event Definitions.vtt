00:00.460 --> 00:04.940
We've updated the common module and now all of our different events expect to be given a version number.

00:04.960 --> 00:07.280
We're going to now go around our ticket service.

00:07.300 --> 00:10.690
We're going to see that there are a couple of locations inside of here where we are trying to publish

00:10.690 --> 00:11.410
an event.

00:11.410 --> 00:16.030
And chances are when we publish those events, we are specifying the exact properties to include.

00:16.240 --> 00:20.800
And chances are we are not including the version number inside of any of those published events.

00:20.800 --> 00:24.910
So we have to go through and just found wherever we are publishing an event and make sure we include

00:24.910 --> 00:25.750
the version number.

00:26.170 --> 00:28.270
We're going to first get started inside of our roots directory.

00:28.750 --> 00:31.120
Inside of here, we're going to find the new file.

00:31.810 --> 00:36.580
As soon as I open this up, I'll see that there is an air right down here where we create an instance

00:36.580 --> 00:40.240
of the ticket creative publisher and try to publish some information about a given ticket.

00:41.400 --> 00:46.920
So if I hover over this error, it's going to say, hey, you said that a event is going to have a version

00:46.920 --> 00:48.330
and we did not provide it.

00:48.570 --> 00:53.010
So all we have to do is include the version of the ticket that we just created.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.510
It's all put into your version, ticket version, and that's it.

00:57.510 --> 00:58.380
Air goes away.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.800
So let's save this file and close it.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.910
And the only other location we have to do in update is inside of updates.

01:05.540 --> 01:06.500
Inside of updates.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.680
I'm going to scroll down a little bit, find our ticket updated publisher.

01:10.100 --> 01:13.700
And so once again, if we hover over the air, it will tell us that we said that we were going to include

01:13.700 --> 01:14.780
a version property.

01:15.290 --> 01:19.670
So we'll put in version and include the version of the updated ticket.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.700
So ticket version.

01:22.700 --> 01:23.360
Like so.

01:26.020 --> 01:26.140
Okay.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.570
So let's save this and close this file.

01:29.020 --> 01:33.610
We should now be able to go back over to our terminal and restart entirely our test suite.

01:33.610 --> 01:35.920
I encourage you to just restart the test suite entirely.

01:36.220 --> 01:40.330
So find your test suite inside the ticket service if you're still running it from a couple of videos

01:40.330 --> 01:40.810
ago.

01:41.230 --> 01:46.360
Stop it with a control C and we'll start it back up with an NP run test and we're just going to make

01:46.360 --> 01:48.370
sure we don't get any TypeScript errors.

01:49.120 --> 01:52.600
I want to make sure that TypeScript is not complaining at us and saying that we try to create an event

01:52.600 --> 01:54.640
without providing a version property.

01:55.210 --> 01:59.080
It looks like all my tests are passing, which means that we have done all the updates inside the ticket

01:59.080 --> 02:00.220
service correctly.

02:00.580 --> 02:01.000
Well.

02:01.870 --> 02:02.810
So this looks good.

02:02.830 --> 02:04.300
I am going to close down.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.350
This test suite because we're not going to come back to the ticket service for a little bit.

02:09.130 --> 02:09.230
Okay.

02:09.310 --> 02:12.370
So we're now going to start to move over to our orders service.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.520
Now there's a couple of different things that need to happen inside the order service.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.600
First off, if we take a look at our ticket definition file right here.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.880
So inside the model directory, find tickets.

02:22.890 --> 02:26.430
We are not including the idea of a version anywhere inside of here.

02:26.610 --> 02:32.100
So remember, including the idea of a version inside of this replicated ticket model is pretty important

02:32.100 --> 02:35.820
because that's what's going to make sure that we always process these events in the correct order.

02:35.940 --> 02:38.760
So if we think back to this diagram.

02:39.950 --> 02:41.030
Right here.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.620
Actually, how about this one?

02:42.770 --> 02:47.780
Inside of our order's database, it was very important for our tickets collection to say that a ticket

02:47.780 --> 02:52.850
had an ID, a price, the title, and very importantly, this aversion thing as well.

02:53.060 --> 02:58.010
So it's really the tickets database and the ticket service that is producing these version numbers.

02:58.010 --> 03:03.200
And it is the orders service and the orders database that is going to consume these version numbers.

03:03.590 --> 03:08.630
So we do have to make sure that our ticket model file inside the order service includes the idea of

03:08.630 --> 03:13.520
a version and make sure that we include this idea of checking those version numbers whenever we try

03:13.520 --> 03:15.560
to somehow process an event.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.620
We do also have to make sure that we wire up all this versioning stuff for our order as well.

03:21.620 --> 03:26.170
So the order model file, very similar to what we had done just a moment ago inside of our ticket file,

03:26.180 --> 03:31.340
back inside the ticket service, we are going to eventually include that mongoose update if version

03:31.340 --> 03:35.990
present or whatever it is called Mongoose update if present, whatever it was, whatever that module

03:35.990 --> 03:40.850
is called, we have to wire that up to our order model in the exact same way that we did back inside

03:40.850 --> 03:43.310
the ticket service specifically.

03:44.780 --> 03:46.160
The tickets file.

03:46.160 --> 03:50.300
So we got to go through this plug in setup and then wire it up to the schema in the same way.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.180
So a little bit of work to do inside the order service.

03:53.190 --> 03:55.320
Let's take care of this in just a moment.
