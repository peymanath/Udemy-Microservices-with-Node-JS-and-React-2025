00:01.210 --> 00:04.810
We've got the tests around the listener passing, but we do have some other failures.

00:04.810 --> 00:06.370
We are going to fix up all those failures.

00:06.370 --> 00:09.430
They're related to a change we made to our ticket model just a little bit ago.

00:09.430 --> 00:12.820
But first, I want to wrap up the tests around the ticket created listener.

00:12.820 --> 00:19.810
So for right now, I'm going to filter the test that we run by pressing W and then P and I'll enter

00:19.810 --> 00:22.780
in the name of the ticket created listener files.

00:22.780 --> 00:26.250
So just ticket created listener should be enough.

00:26.770 --> 00:27.310
Now I'm going to run.

00:27.310 --> 00:30.940
Just test out that file again just to hide those other kind of annoying failures.

00:31.240 --> 00:31.780
Very good.

00:32.630 --> 00:33.290
Kate back inside.

00:33.290 --> 00:35.930
My editor now going to wrap up the second test right here.

00:36.140 --> 00:40.850
So the only goal of this test is to make sure that we actually call the function after we have somehow

00:40.850 --> 00:42.110
processed the event.

00:42.410 --> 00:46.910
We're going to go through a very similar series of steps where we first call setup, then call on message,

00:46.910 --> 00:48.500
and then write out some assertion.

00:48.530 --> 00:51.320
So let's get to it at the very top of the test.

00:51.830 --> 00:53.000
We will get.

00:54.900 --> 00:59.730
Data listener and message from a wait setup.

01:02.430 --> 01:06.900
Well then call the on message function and we'll pass in the data object and the message objects so

01:06.900 --> 01:09.600
await listener on message.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.730
And pass in data and message.

01:14.930 --> 01:19.100
And then finally we need to write an assertion to make sure that the act function on that message object

01:19.100 --> 01:20.120
was actually called.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.780
It's a pretty straightforward to do that will do expect.

01:24.820 --> 01:28.360
MSG to have been felt.

01:29.650 --> 01:30.400
So let's say that.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.420
Check our tests.

01:31.870 --> 01:33.460
Looks good as usual.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.320
Make it fail.

01:34.330 --> 01:37.270
We'll say not to have been called very quickly.

01:38.350 --> 01:38.620
Yep.

01:38.620 --> 01:39.400
Definitely fails.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.870
Definitely gets called one time.

01:41.580 --> 01:44.620
I will remove that dot and we are good to go.

01:45.610 --> 01:45.960
Well.

01:46.090 --> 01:48.070
Well, I would say that looks pretty reasonable.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.540
So let's take a quick pause right here.

01:49.540 --> 01:52.870
We're going to come back the next video and we're going to fix up some of those other tests we have

01:52.870 --> 01:54.310
inside of our order service.

01:54.310 --> 01:58.660
I know it's very off topic from all this listener stuff, but is something that we broke just a little

01:58.660 --> 02:01.690
bit ago when we were working on these listeners and we just never quite saw it.

02:01.690 --> 02:03.340
Those tests were failing until right now.

02:03.580 --> 02:08.650
The little divergence in the next video and then come back to testing our ticket updated listener as

02:08.650 --> 02:09.070
well.
