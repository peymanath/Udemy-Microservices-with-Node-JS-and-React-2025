WEBVTT

00:01.180 --> 00:04.660
We're now going to go back over to our common module and inside of all the different events we have

00:04.660 --> 00:05.500
created inside of here.

00:05.530 --> 00:09.520
We're going to make sure that we communicate the version number inside of these things.

00:09.520 --> 00:13.960
So, for example, in the case of ticket updated, along with some information about the ticket that

00:13.960 --> 00:17.830
was just updated, we're also going to include this ticket's version number, and that is what is going

00:17.830 --> 00:21.400
to eventually help us make sure that we process these events in the correct order.

00:21.940 --> 00:26.110
Before we add in this version number, however, I want to try to answer a question that you might be

00:26.110 --> 00:31.780
asking yourself right now, and that question might be something like this When should we increment

00:31.780 --> 00:34.840
or include the version number of a record with an event?

00:34.840 --> 00:36.070
Should it be all the time?

00:36.070 --> 00:41.020
Should every single event that ever talks about some record always increment a version number or always

00:41.020 --> 00:41.740
include it?

00:41.950 --> 00:42.910
The answer is no.

00:43.240 --> 00:49.360
We are only going to worry about incrementing or including the version number of a record whenever it

00:49.360 --> 00:55.810
is the primary service responsible for a record that is emitting an event to describe that record either

00:55.810 --> 00:58.270
being created, updated or destroyed.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.690
Now, this rule alone by itself doesn't really make a lot of sense and I don't think really answers

01:03.690 --> 01:04.440
this question.

01:04.440 --> 01:09.570
So let me just show you a hypothetical scenario back inside of that blog post application we worked

01:09.570 --> 01:11.460
on much earlier inside this course.

01:11.460 --> 01:16.290
And when we walk through this hypothetical scenario, I think you're going to understand this answer

01:16.290 --> 01:17.160
a little bit better.

01:18.730 --> 01:18.940
Okay.

01:18.940 --> 01:20.820
So here's the blogpost application.

01:20.830 --> 01:24.250
We're looking just at the comment service, moderation and query.

01:24.790 --> 01:26.280
So remember how this thing worked.

01:26.290 --> 01:30.640
Whenever a user came to the comment service to create a comment, we would emit an event of comment

01:30.640 --> 01:35.230
created and that would go over to the moderation service and the query service.

01:36.120 --> 01:41.430
The Moderation Service would then moderate the comment in some way and it would emit an event of comment

01:41.430 --> 01:45.270
moderated that was only received by the comment service.

01:45.600 --> 01:50.250
The comment service then processed that update event and it said, okay, I need to somehow moderate

01:50.250 --> 01:52.620
this comment or handle the moderation event.

01:52.620 --> 01:55.620
And it may have made a change to the content of the comment.

01:56.370 --> 02:01.290
The comment service would then emit a follow up event of comment updated.

02:02.650 --> 02:05.320
And that would go on down to the query service and the query service.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.180
Then New OC.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.350
This thing has been moderated.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.500
We are all good to go.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.460
That was the flow of events back inside of that blog post application.

02:12.890 --> 02:17.560
So now I want to imagine what would happen if we did not follow this rule right here, if we said that

02:17.560 --> 02:22.270
any old service can increment the version number of a record whenever it felt like it.

02:23.470 --> 02:24.580
So here's what would happen.

02:25.700 --> 02:30.380
We can have our common service, and we're going to imagine that this thing is going to publish this

02:30.380 --> 02:36.020
comment created event, and it's going to include a version number by default, version zero.

02:36.550 --> 02:38.420
So that's going to go over to the moderation service.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.750
And query service.

02:41.620 --> 02:46.680
Now the moderation service will once again do the moderation and then it's going to emit comment moderated.

02:46.680 --> 02:50.010
And we're going to say for just a moment that we are not going to follow this rule.

02:50.010 --> 02:52.010
So I'm going to show you what we should not do.

02:52.020 --> 02:54.270
This is not what we want to do at all.

02:54.840 --> 02:58.830
So we're going to say that when the moderation service kind of processes this comment, the Moderation

02:58.830 --> 03:02.490
Service might think, Oh, well, I've kind of done some processing on this comment.

03:02.490 --> 03:04.230
I've kind of updated it in some way.

03:04.230 --> 03:04.890
So you know what?

03:04.890 --> 03:06.510
I'm going to update the version number.

03:06.510 --> 03:09.600
And again, that's not what we want, but let's just imagine it happens for a second.

03:10.110 --> 03:12.000
So we'd put on a version number of one.

03:13.320 --> 03:18.300
So now this event was processed only by the Common Service, remember, that was not processed by the

03:18.300 --> 03:19.260
query service at all.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.380
Now the comment service takes a look at that thing.

03:22.380 --> 03:24.000
It says, okay, the comment was moderated.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.050
I'm going to process this.

03:25.050 --> 03:30.210
I'm going to say this comment has been moderated and then eventually emit the comment updated events

03:30.750 --> 03:34.500
presumably as a part of the comment service processing common moderated.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.340
It will presumably also see that it has a version number of one.

03:38.610 --> 03:44.460
And so when Common Service emits comment updated, we're going to assume that in turn it decides to

03:44.460 --> 03:49.410
take that version number, add one to it, and then emit that as the final update.

03:49.410 --> 03:53.790
So instead of comment updated, we would imagine that this thing would have a version of two.

03:54.580 --> 03:57.610
So now think about this solely from the query service perspective.

03:57.610 --> 03:59.890
We can forget everything else that's going on here.

04:01.270 --> 04:03.880
And just think about it from the service perspective.

04:04.030 --> 04:08.350
The service has now seen a event of comet created and had a version of zero.

04:08.350 --> 04:09.790
So record being created.

04:09.790 --> 04:10.420
Fantastic.

04:10.420 --> 04:13.360
Let's save that record internally inside a query service.

04:13.630 --> 04:18.850
And now the next event that the query service would expect to see should have a version of one.

04:19.210 --> 04:24.280
But that never comes because the record that tried to say, Hey, here's version one never got received

04:24.280 --> 04:26.050
or processed by the query service.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.340
And so the next event that this thing would receive would have a version of two, and the query service

04:30.340 --> 04:34.900
would say, Oh, I'm missing out on version one, so I'm going to reject version two.

04:35.860 --> 04:39.370
And not process it until I eventually receive an event of version one.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.740
Well, naturally, it's never going to receive version one.

04:41.740 --> 04:46.300
So the query service is now going to be stuck and never be able to process this event right here.

04:47.540 --> 04:52.190
So all this could have been prevented if we followed this rule right here.

04:52.190 --> 04:56.840
And we said that only the primary service responsible for record is going to be in charge of incrementing

04:56.840 --> 04:57.830
a version number.

04:58.250 --> 05:02.840
So if we apply that rule, we would have said that the common created event right here at the version

05:02.840 --> 05:08.450
of Zero Moderation Service would have sent back comment moderated and it would have not included some

05:08.450 --> 05:09.500
incremented version number.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.450
It can include the version number.

05:11.480 --> 05:12.350
No problem there.

05:12.350 --> 05:13.610
It can include the version number.

05:13.610 --> 05:19.660
But we would definitely not have this other service or this service that is not truly in charge of comments.

05:19.670 --> 05:20.750
Increment the number.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.220
Now the common service would receive moderated.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.210
It would do some processing.

05:25.210 --> 05:26.980
It would update common internally.

05:27.010 --> 05:30.870
And now the new version number would be one common service would emit common updated.

05:30.880 --> 05:36.730
We'd have a version of one and now query service can see version zero, version one, no problem less

05:36.730 --> 05:38.590
process this right here, version one.

05:39.130 --> 05:45.070
So long story short, we're going to make sure that only the service that is responsible for a record

05:45.070 --> 05:50.470
like the actual definition, the true canonical definition of what a record is, is going to be responsible

05:50.470 --> 05:53.410
for incrementing and including that incremented version number.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.490
Now, again, this diagram here might be just a little bit misleading because I put the word include

05:57.490 --> 06:00.520
it is okay if other services include the version number.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.100
And as a matter of fact, we might want to have them include that version number, as we just saw here

06:04.100 --> 06:05.170
with the moderation service.

06:05.170 --> 06:05.980
Totally okay.

06:05.980 --> 06:07.360
To include the version number.

06:07.360 --> 06:11.450
What we're really talking about right now is whether or not this other service increments that version

06:11.450 --> 06:11.680
number.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.420
And the answer is no, not at all.

06:14.150 --> 06:14.420
Okay.

06:14.420 --> 06:20.030
I apologize for the long aside, but as I mentioned, I thought this might be a question you had, especially

06:20.030 --> 06:24.830
as we go into our common module and start to include the version number on all these different events.

06:25.810 --> 06:29.590
So let's take a pause right here and actually update this thing in just a moment.
