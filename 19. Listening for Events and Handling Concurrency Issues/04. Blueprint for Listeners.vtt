00:01.100 --> 00:02.890
Let's get started working on our first listener.

00:02.900 --> 00:05.300
It's going to be the ticket created listener.

00:05.690 --> 00:08.800
So instead of my order service, I'll find the events directory inside there.

00:08.810 --> 00:11.030
I'll make a new folder of listeners.

00:12.360 --> 00:16.110
And then inside of listeners, I'll make a new file of ticket created.

00:16.110 --> 00:16.770
Listener.

00:17.130 --> 00:17.690
Yes.

00:19.530 --> 00:22.170
Well, then start to put some implementation together right away.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.410
We're going to end up with a couple of different import statements at the very top.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.900
So let's add in a couple of different imports.

00:28.350 --> 00:30.840
First, we will get the message type.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.040
From Nanette Streaming.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.020
I'm going to get my subjects, you know?

00:37.780 --> 00:39.790
By listener base class.

00:40.510 --> 00:43.330
And the ticket created event.

00:43.750 --> 00:45.430
All those from my common module.

00:48.510 --> 00:51.630
I'm also going to get my ticket model.

00:51.660 --> 00:56.340
So from my model's directory right here, I'll get ticket.

00:57.260 --> 00:59.030
From up to directories.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.310
Models.

01:02.170 --> 01:02.710
Ticket.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.010
And I think that's probably all we need for right now.

01:09.030 --> 01:11.610
So let's start to put the actual implementation for this thing together.

01:11.850 --> 01:18.600
So first off, we're going to export a class of ticket created listener and very similar to what we're

01:18.600 --> 01:19.920
doing with our different publishers.

01:19.920 --> 01:24.150
We are going to be extending an abstract class, in this case listener.

01:24.750 --> 01:28.380
And remember, this is a generic, which means we have to provide a type.

01:28.380 --> 01:32.040
And the type we're going to stick in here is the type of event that we're going to listen for, which

01:32.040 --> 01:33.450
is ticket created event.

01:33.780 --> 01:36.780
So I will plug in ticket related event like so.

01:38.120 --> 01:42.290
Well then see our class name light up and TypeScript is telling us that there are three different properties

01:42.290 --> 01:46.400
we have to implement inside of here, all because we are extending that abstract class.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.120
So we have to implement on message your group name and subject.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.890
We'll first start off with subject.

01:52.220 --> 01:56.000
So we'll write in the subject right here and we're going to use the exact same system that we use back

01:56.000 --> 01:57.100
on our publishers.

01:57.110 --> 02:02.420
We're going to define or declare the subject property and we're going to give it the very specific type

02:02.420 --> 02:03.490
that this thing is going to be.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.500
So we'll say subjects ticket created.

02:07.430 --> 02:09.650
And then we're going to actually assign it a value.

02:09.680 --> 02:15.410
Those subjects dot ticket created and remember this kind of two step process right here is to make sure

02:15.410 --> 02:20.420
that TypeScript enforces us, to never be able to change that subject property at any point in time.

02:21.680 --> 02:21.800
Now.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.440
Next up, we're going to define our Q group name.

02:24.770 --> 02:31.100
So Q group name in this case is going to be our orders service.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.910
And like I said, I'll give you a reminder on what that group name is in just a moment.

02:36.850 --> 02:40.060
And then finally we'll define our on message function.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.830
So this is going to receive two arguments.

02:42.850 --> 02:47.350
First is going to be the data from inside of our event, and the second is going to be the message from

02:47.350 --> 02:49.060
the node net streaming library.

02:49.790 --> 02:55.520
So put in here data and that's going to be up type ticket related event at data.

02:56.420 --> 02:59.660
And the second argument will be message and that will be of type message.

03:01.160 --> 03:01.460
All right.

03:01.460 --> 03:05.510
So I apologize for kind of speeding through this and saying, oh, yeah, we'll come back to this and

03:05.510 --> 03:07.850
we'll come back to this and this message thing and so on.

03:07.850 --> 03:11.600
But I really just want to throw this code together because this is going to be very similar to what

03:11.600 --> 03:13.280
all of our different listeners look like.

03:13.400 --> 03:18.230
All of our different listeners are going to extend the listener base class, have the event type plugged

03:18.230 --> 03:22.520
into it, and then define a subject, a group name, and then on message.

03:23.060 --> 03:27.050
Now that we've established this kind of as the blueprint that we're going to be copy pasting over and

03:27.050 --> 03:28.040
over and over again.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.150
Another quick pause right here.

03:29.150 --> 03:33.890
When we come back to the next video, we're going to get a reminder on what that group name is, why

03:33.890 --> 03:38.780
we have this weird annotation for data right here, and a reminder on what this message thing is as

03:38.780 --> 03:39.290
well.
