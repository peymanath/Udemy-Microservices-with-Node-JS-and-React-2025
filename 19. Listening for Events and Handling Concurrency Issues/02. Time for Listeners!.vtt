00:00.950 --> 00:03.980
We've now got some publishers put together inside of our order service.

00:03.980 --> 00:08.360
And at this point in time I'm really excited because we've got publishers available inside the order

00:08.360 --> 00:10.820
service and inside the ticket service.

00:11.390 --> 00:13.170
So here's what we're going to start to work on.

00:13.190 --> 00:17.400
We're going to start to put together some number of listeners in these two services.

00:17.420 --> 00:22.460
Remember that the goal of a listener is to process some number of incoming events inside of both these

00:22.460 --> 00:25.220
services, we have to create two different listeners.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.450
So you might recall seeing this diagram right here, it was a diagram of where all of these different

00:29.450 --> 00:31.460
events are coming from and where they're going to.

00:32.490 --> 00:37.480
So for the ticket created event, we need to make sure that the order service receives this event or

00:37.480 --> 00:39.210
it listens for ticket created.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.330
And I've got some notes on here about what that listener needs to do.

00:43.150 --> 00:46.120
The Order service also needs to listen for ticket updated.

00:46.510 --> 00:48.010
That's two listeners at least.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.810
We have to build inside the order service.

00:50.540 --> 00:55.160
Then inside the ticket service, we need to make sure that thing listens for the order created event

00:55.640 --> 00:57.980
and for the order canceled event.

00:59.080 --> 01:04.750
We're going to first begin working on our listeners for creating a ticket and updating a ticket.

01:04.750 --> 01:08.140
So these are both listeners we're going to put together inside of our orders service.

01:08.770 --> 01:12.790
Now, the reason I'm so excited about this is that this is where we're going to start to see some crazy

01:12.790 --> 01:17.410
concurrency issues start to come up, and we're going to have to figure out how to solve these concurrency

01:17.410 --> 01:18.040
issues.

01:18.280 --> 01:23.710
You might recall discussing this diagram a little bit ago, a couple of hours ago inside the course

01:24.100 --> 01:30.220
where we discussed having some of these events of ticket created and ticket updated come in to our application

01:30.220 --> 01:31.660
in some weird order.

01:31.660 --> 01:36.550
And we saw that if they get processed in a weird order, we could end up with some super invalid data.

01:37.030 --> 01:42.880
So we eventually came up with a solution of using this version field to somehow track in order these

01:42.880 --> 01:44.560
different events inside of our app.

01:44.860 --> 01:49.330
So this is where we're going to start to go back to all this concurrency stuff and implement this versioning

01:49.330 --> 01:49.870
thing.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.100
So again, the first stuff we're going to put together, we're going to get a listener put together

01:54.100 --> 01:57.700
for ticket created and ticket updated inside of our order service.

01:57.700 --> 02:02.140
And as soon as we do, that's what we're going to start to see these version number start to become

02:02.140 --> 02:03.130
really important.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.060
All right.

02:04.060 --> 02:07.270
So now we've got a little kind of preview of what we're going to be focusing on.

02:07.270 --> 02:08.500
Let's take a quick pause right here.

02:08.500 --> 02:12.460
We're going to get a quick reminder on how we create a listener in the next video.
