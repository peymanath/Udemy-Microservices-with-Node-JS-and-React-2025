In this video.

00:01.470 --> 00:03.970
We're going to get a quick reminder on how we create a listener.

00:03.990 --> 00:09.120
So you might recall that inside of our common module in the CRC directory and the events folder, we

00:09.120 --> 00:11.430
had created that base listener class.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.440
This was an abstract class.

00:13.440 --> 00:18.060
And so we're going to extend this to build out different classes inside of each of our services that

00:18.060 --> 00:20.250
are going to listen for very specific events.

00:20.730 --> 00:25.650
When we extend this listener, we're going to make sure we provide a event type as the generic type.

00:26.220 --> 00:30.660
And then inside of the child class, we're also going to be required to define a subject.

00:30.660 --> 00:34.950
So this can be a subject we want to listen to on that streaming server, a queue group name, and we'll

00:34.950 --> 00:36.930
get a reminder on what that's about really quickly.

00:36.930 --> 00:42.090
And then finally, the on message function, the on message function is what's going to actually receive

00:42.090 --> 00:42.630
an event.

00:42.630 --> 00:45.150
That's what we're going to implement some amount of business logic.

00:45.660 --> 00:50.370
The first argument is going to be the data inside the event, and the second argument will be a message

00:50.370 --> 00:53.210
and we'll get a reminder on what that message is in a little bit as well.

00:54.100 --> 00:57.910
The other thing I want to remind you about is that when we create an instance of a listener, we have

00:57.910 --> 01:00.130
to provide a Nat's client to it.

01:01.670 --> 01:05.720
When we create an instance of a listener and provide the next client that doesn't actually start this

01:05.720 --> 01:06.620
thing up listening.

01:06.620 --> 01:10.990
Instead, we have to call the Listen method, which we had defined down here.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.530
This is what is going to actually tell the client to start to subscribe or create a subscription and

01:15.530 --> 01:18.410
listen for events on a very particular subject or channel.

01:18.980 --> 01:23.960
Then whenever we receive a message, that is when we were going to actually call the on message function.

01:25.390 --> 01:29.380
So in total, in order to create a listener, we're going to create a new file inside of our different

01:29.380 --> 01:29.950
services.

01:29.950 --> 01:32.980
It's going to extend this base listener class.

01:32.980 --> 01:36.940
We're going to plug in the event type we want to listen for and then define a couple of different properties

01:36.940 --> 01:37.570
inside of it.

01:37.570 --> 01:38.710
And that's pretty much it.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.450
Now, as a reminder, the first listen we're going to put together is going to be listening for the

01:43.450 --> 01:48.670
ticket created event, and we're going to implement that inside of our order service.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.450
So let's take a quick pause right here and then start to implement this first listener in the next video.
