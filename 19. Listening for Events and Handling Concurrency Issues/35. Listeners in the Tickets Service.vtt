00:00.880 --> 00:02.680
So what are we going to work on next?

00:02.710 --> 00:07.300
Well, at this point in time, we have wired up our order service that is listening to the ticket created

00:07.300 --> 00:09.790
event and the ticket updated events.

00:09.790 --> 00:13.240
So Order Service is processing those events pretty darn well.

00:13.540 --> 00:16.950
The order service in turn is also emitting a couple events.

00:16.960 --> 00:21.790
So for example, the order service is publishing order created and order canceled.

00:22.300 --> 00:27.340
We need to now make sure that the ticket service is going to have a listener that's going to watch for

00:27.340 --> 00:30.460
the order created event and the order canceled event.

00:30.670 --> 00:35.740
The reason for this, remember, is we need to make sure that we lock down a ticket after an order has

00:35.740 --> 00:36.930
been created for it.

00:36.940 --> 00:41.980
So once a ticket has been reserved, the ticket service needs to make sure that the person who owns

00:41.980 --> 00:46.750
this ticket, the person who created the ticket, cannot come back and start to edit it because we don't

00:46.750 --> 00:51.850
want a user to start to go through the process of purchasing a ticket and then see the price just mysteriously

00:51.850 --> 00:54.340
change or the description change or anything like that.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.600
So to implement that, we're going to go back over to our ticket service.

00:57.610 --> 01:00.070
We're going to implement two different listeners.

01:00.340 --> 01:06.160
Whenever the ticket service sees a list or an event of order created, we're going to find the appropriate

01:06.160 --> 01:10.990
ticket inside the ticket service and set something on there that's going to lock down that ticket and

01:10.990 --> 01:13.420
prevent us from making any further changes to it.

01:14.200 --> 01:19.390
Then whenever we see an order canceled event which indicates that the person who's trying to buy the

01:19.390 --> 01:24.070
ticket says, forget this, I don't want the ticket, or maybe the order times out or whatever else.

01:24.070 --> 01:29.350
We're then going to make sure that we unreserved the ticket or essentially unlock it down and allow

01:29.350 --> 01:30.940
editing of the ticket once again.

01:31.180 --> 01:32.070
So that's pretty much it.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.060
It's pretty much an on off lag.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.880
Whenever we see what are created, lock the ticket.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.700
Whenever we see cancelled, unlock the ticket, that's all it is.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.320
So not the worst thing in the world.

01:42.170 --> 01:46.160
Now that we've got an idea of what we're doing, pause right here, start to implement this in the next

01:46.160 --> 01:46.760
video.
