WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:02.480
Our set up function is complete.

00:02.480 --> 00:05.030
We're now going to start to write out some tests around our order created.

00:05.030 --> 00:07.910
Listener So we'll throw down a first test right here.

00:07.910 --> 00:09.650
What do we really care about testing here?

00:09.650 --> 00:16.160
Well, we probably really want to make sure that we take the ticket and we set its ID or the order ID

00:16.160 --> 00:20.200
property equal to whatever the order ID was out of the data object.

00:20.210 --> 00:21.230
That's the big goal here.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.760
That's what we're really trying to do.

00:23.240 --> 00:27.890
We also, of course, care about acting the message as well, assuming everything goes as expected.

00:28.890 --> 00:31.080
So we're going to write out to success case tests.

00:31.080 --> 00:36.420
Once again, we'll say it sets the user ID of the ticket.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.670
We'll do one test for that.

00:41.920 --> 00:49.300
And then another test to say that it calls the message or I think in our previous test, we just simply

00:49.300 --> 00:52.630
said axe the message just to be a little bit more concise.

00:56.660 --> 00:56.740
Okay.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.510
So our first test right here, we'll call our setup function.

00:59.510 --> 01:00.920
It is an async function.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.860
We'll just make sure that we use the awake keyword on it.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.580
We'll pull out the listener ticket data and message.

01:08.350 --> 01:09.880
From a wait setup.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.200
Looks good.

01:12.830 --> 01:18.530
So we're then going to take our listeners on message function and call it with the data and message

01:18.530 --> 01:19.280
arguments.

01:20.220 --> 01:24.660
So await listener on message, pass in data and message.

01:25.140 --> 01:27.030
Then we can write out our expectation.

01:27.390 --> 01:30.150
So in this case, we want to reach into our database once again.

01:30.150 --> 01:35.700
We want to find the ticket that has presumably been updated inside there, and then just make sure that

01:35.700 --> 01:39.030
the ticket has its user or order ID property set.

01:39.730 --> 01:43.690
Now, the ticket that we already have inside of here, that is an out of date ticket document.

01:43.720 --> 01:48.310
Presumably we have already written an updated version back into our data collection or the collection

01:48.310 --> 01:49.270
of all of our different tickets.

01:49.270 --> 01:51.190
So we do have to re fetch this thing.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.350
We'll say updated ticket.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.890
Is a wait ticket find by ID.

01:57.070 --> 02:00.970
We want to find the ticket with the same ID as the one we have right here.

02:00.970 --> 02:04.330
But again, we have to re fetch this thing because it has some out of date data.

02:05.630 --> 02:09.840
So we'll then take a look at the updated ticket and just make sure that it's audited property is set.

02:09.860 --> 02:10.520
That's it.

02:11.770 --> 02:13.210
They'll do and expect.

02:14.470 --> 02:16.840
Updated ticket, exclamation.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.100
Order ID.

02:19.980 --> 02:23.880
To equal the data objects ID.

02:25.350 --> 02:30.360
So data ID and again, data ID is the ID of the order that we had just created.

02:31.090 --> 02:32.110
And that should be it.

02:32.900 --> 02:33.670
So let's save this.

02:33.680 --> 02:38.420
We'll go back over to our terminal and start up our test suite inside of our tickets service.

02:40.470 --> 02:42.480
I still have the test going for my order service right here.

02:42.480 --> 02:46.200
I'm going to close all that stuff down because they're really focused on the ticket service right now.

02:47.310 --> 02:51.480
I'll go back over two tickets to an NPN run test and we'll see how we're doing now.

02:51.480 --> 02:55.890
We might see some other failures inside of here or all those kind of same versioning issues around our

02:56.100 --> 02:57.660
handlers we saw a little bit ago.

02:57.660 --> 02:59.070
So some other stuff is failing.

02:59.070 --> 02:59.730
That's okay.

02:59.770 --> 03:01.590
Looks like we're okay in this case, however.

03:01.770 --> 03:03.360
So that looks fantastic.

03:04.050 --> 03:07.260
And I just want to find my listener test right there in particular.

03:08.010 --> 03:10.890
Let's filter our test and just run the listener one.

03:12.710 --> 03:15.500
So I'll do a P and then listener.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.430
And they'll make sure that that thing fails as usual.

03:21.460 --> 03:25.660
I know the steps seems kind of arbitrary and not important, but you would be surprised how often you

03:25.660 --> 03:29.980
can actually capture a little mistakes in your testing by making sure that stuff actually does fail.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.170
So I will comment that thing out now.

03:32.170 --> 03:37.660
We should not be sending the order ID property at all, and we do in fact see this thing fail.

03:37.870 --> 03:39.070
So that's fantastic.

03:40.630 --> 03:40.790
Okay.

03:40.810 --> 03:41.680
Back to working.

03:42.130 --> 03:45.370
Let's now also take care of making sure that we act the message as well.

03:46.990 --> 03:48.850
We're going to again do the setup step.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.430
Copy, paste that down.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.150
We're going to call on message once again.

03:52.180 --> 03:52.480
Copy.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.320
Paste that down.

03:54.210 --> 03:58.460
And then we can take a look at the message property and just make sure it was invoked.

03:58.470 --> 04:02.460
So expect message to have been dealt.

04:03.680 --> 04:04.900
So I'm going to save that.

04:05.950 --> 04:06.640
Passes.

04:06.640 --> 04:07.960
Comment out on message.

04:07.960 --> 04:08.800
Save it.

04:09.610 --> 04:10.210
Bales.

04:10.210 --> 04:11.500
Everything is good to go.

04:11.860 --> 04:12.280
Cool.

04:13.440 --> 04:13.770
All right.

04:13.770 --> 04:16.920
Well, I'd say that our order created listener looks pretty reasonable.

04:17.130 --> 04:20.060
But there might be one or two other things we want to take care of inside of here.

04:20.070 --> 04:25.320
So let's take a quick pause to kind of walk through this entire workflow of resolving a ticket or reserving

04:25.320 --> 04:28.410
a ticket and some things we might want to do along that process.
