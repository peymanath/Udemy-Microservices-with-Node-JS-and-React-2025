00:01.560 --> 00:03.600
Our ticket created publisher is put together.

00:03.600 --> 00:08.460
So we're now going to go over to our roots directory, find the new route handler.

00:09.780 --> 00:10.770
Inside of here.

00:10.770 --> 00:15.510
Like we just said, right after creating the ticket and saving to the database, we then want to publish

00:15.510 --> 00:16.320
an event.

00:16.680 --> 00:19.980
So let's import the publisher into this file and publish an event.

00:21.260 --> 00:21.950
At the very top.

00:21.950 --> 00:26.390
We're going to import our ticket created publisher.

00:27.230 --> 00:29.960
From up one directory events publishers.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.580
Ticket Created Publisher.

00:34.680 --> 00:34.900
Okay.

00:34.980 --> 00:36.450
Well, then go down towards the bottom.

00:36.990 --> 00:39.540
And then right after we do that ticket save call.

00:40.430 --> 00:41.300
We will.

00:42.670 --> 00:44.590
New ticket created.

00:46.090 --> 00:46.870
Publisher.

00:48.210 --> 00:51.090
When we call this, we need to pass in the active nets clients.

00:51.090 --> 00:52.980
We do not have that inside of our project yet.

00:52.980 --> 00:57.360
So we have not actually established a connection to nets at any point in time inside of here, but we

00:57.360 --> 00:58.590
will do that very shortly.

00:58.590 --> 01:02.790
So for right now, I'm just going to throw in client and I'm going to assume that I will come back and

01:02.790 --> 01:04.170
fix that up in just a moment.

01:05.040 --> 01:08.130
Well, then call it publish and pass in an object.

01:09.960 --> 01:14.430
So if we take a look at this thing or the air on that object, it will give us a reminder on all the

01:14.430 --> 01:15.850
properties we have to provide.

01:15.870 --> 01:19.620
So we need to throw in an ID title price and user ID.

01:19.920 --> 01:22.770
Now, there's a little quick note on this I want to throw out there.

01:22.800 --> 01:26.580
The ID naturally has to be pulled directly off this ticket model.

01:27.090 --> 01:29.460
So we have to do something like ticket ID.

01:30.360 --> 01:38.130
But for the other attributes such as title price and user ID, you might be a little tempted to emit

01:38.130 --> 01:43.800
the title and price directly off the request body and the user id directly off of req.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.730
Current user ID because hey, it's all the same information, right?

01:47.970 --> 01:50.930
In other words, you might want to put inside of here just title.

01:50.940 --> 01:56.190
So pulling the title from the request body as opposed to referencing the tickets title.

01:57.530 --> 02:00.350
Again, you might think these are really the same exact titles.

02:00.470 --> 02:02.760
The title right here is the same as the title on the ticket.

02:02.780 --> 02:04.080
Well, not necessarily.

02:04.100 --> 02:08.390
Remember that with Mongoose we can implement some pre and post save hooks.

02:08.630 --> 02:11.870
We can do some validation or sanitization on these values.

02:12.050 --> 02:18.020
So the value that came in off the request body is not necessarily the same as what actually got saved

02:18.020 --> 02:19.100
to the database.

02:19.610 --> 02:25.070
So I really recommend pulling the title or all these relevant attributes directly off of the ticket

02:25.070 --> 02:29.720
that we just saved to the database, as opposed to pulling the title and price off the request body.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.690
Because again, they might actually be different values.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.480
So we're going to put in the title off the ticket.

02:37.050 --> 02:39.360
We'll put in the price also off the ticket.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.120
I'll put in the user ID also off the ticket.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.450
Now, this is a synchronous call right here.

02:50.450 --> 02:52.420
So we kind of have a big decision to make.

02:52.430 --> 02:55.210
Do we want to await this entire operation?

02:55.220 --> 02:59.840
Do we want to wait for the publish to be completed before we send back response to the user?

03:00.200 --> 03:03.230
Well, that's kind of an interesting question, and it's something that we're going to discuss in just

03:03.230 --> 03:03.830
a moment.

03:03.980 --> 03:05.420
But right now, let's take a quick pause.

03:05.450 --> 03:08.960
When we come back, the next video we're going to discuss how we're going to create this next client

03:08.960 --> 03:14.240
inside of our project, because, as usual, it's going to end up being just a little bit more complicated

03:14.240 --> 03:16.160
than it might seem at first glance.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.660
So a quick pause right here.

03:17.850 --> 03:19.040
Continue in just a minute.
